My girl ate it over the course of 8-10 months. There were many times when I'd put it in her bowl and she'd look up at me as if to say, ""Ugh, isn't there anything else?"" This is a dog who will eat carrots, kale, rabbit poop, dog poop...so I know she's not picky. 😆  All the more reason to investigate when she doesn't like the taste of something.After keeping a poop journal ( because yes, I'm THAT dog mom and also poop tell us what's going on in the body) I realized that her poops were always progressively runny as the day went on. Every. Single. Day. We feed 3x a day and she poops about 3 or 4x per day. I always clean it up, so yeah...I notice the subtle changes in the consistency. The only poop that was 100% solid was the first one of the day. Then it would get softer and softer until it was so runny that we'd go on walks and I couldn't even bag it. Also, she's a long-haired breed, so THAT's been a joy to deal with. 🤮 🤮 🤮I switched to another brand...Wellness https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BORBHO...and holy 💩, ALL of her poops are ALL NORMAL.

There is at least one well regarded dog food review web site that also keeps track of recalls.  After a couple of disasters with pet food made in an unmentionable country or two I try to stick with well regarded brands that aren't made in those countries.  Many brands that used to be good have succumbed to the profit margin unfortunately.  Blue Buffalo consistently gets good reviews and as far as I know has never had a recall at least in recent history.  My dog apparently developed a sensitivity for chicken based dog food which is weird because he can eat fresh chicken with no ill effects meanwhile a chicken based dry food results in an explosively upset stomach (tired of cleaning that mess of puddles up off the floor kind of upset stomach).  My local stores have stopped stocking the big bags of this food which is the best value for the price so I order when I have to and amazon always comes through with the fastest arrival time to my door.  It's tough for me to wrangle a thirty pound bag of food out of the car anyway so shipping's probably the best for me anyway.  My dog seems to enjoy this and when the bag arrives at the front door it always gets wags and five minutes of insistent sniffing when it's taken out of the box.  They have several foods for sensitive metabolisms, apparently chicken sensitivity is common in dogs (if I had to guess I'd say all the junk we shoot chickens up with on the farms, hormones, etc.).  I've used this one and the salmon version he does great on both just the salmon is a bit higher priced.  Normally they say don't suddenly change your dog's diet but when the lamb can't be found he doesn't seem to have an issue going back and forth between this and the salmon.",True

Additionally, we had a friend that fed his dog a high protein diet for the past several years and his dog now had cardiomyopathy, which had been related to high protein diets, even though it was marketed as “healthier” for dogs and more expensive.I finally decided to try switching again and picked Royal Canin, which came with good reviews from several sources. I’ve been splitting his food to transition him for the past several weeks, but placing each brand on opposite sides of the bowl.

She has ballooned to 116 pounds in June since I am no longer able to take her for long walks. With the weight gain she has become lethargic, sleeping all hours even during the day and has become uninterested in playing with any of her toys. In addition to her not getting enough exercise she is acting very depressed and I can relate it to first the loss of mybeloved Australian Sheppard ""Dito"" 6 months ago and 2 weeks later the death of my wonderful husband in May from COVID.  We all need to exercise and eat our way back to health. I talked to my vet and did my own research and found the Blue Buffalo Healthy Weight Life protection formula. The cost was out of my reach in our local grocery store so I checked here on Amazon. On August 1st I bought a 30 lb bag of the chicken and brown rice formula for $35.53. Daisy did not complain at all as I started to mix it gradually into her food. Feeding her 2 cups twice daily she started to lose weight without begging for scraps or treats so I assume she was satisfied. A visit in September to the vet had a weigh in of 101 pounds. Amazing. She was able to jump up on the bed, looking to play tug with her giant rope and had a little spirit again. The vet wants her at 80 pounds so we intend to keep her on this food. Due to the mixing with daisy's old food for the first 14 day, that bag lasted 7 weeks. I purchased another 30 lb bag on September 20 for $34.26. I was checking prices on Prime Day for many of the deals and decided to buy another bag before I ran out and was shocked to find the price ""Starting at $54.88"" for the same 30 lb bag and not available as prime. That is a $20.00 increase!! Why?? I will find it very difficult to spend that much and I do not want to switch her food when she is doing so well now.

She is not overweight so I bought Blue weight control! Few months back I bought a bag and it was full of weevils & bugs. Target gave me a refund and I threw it out, I did contact the company and Blue blame Target. Okay THEN last bag made my baby very ill, horrible bloody stools so bad I had to take her to the pet ER. Next day my regular Vet told me to STOP feeding Blue Buffalo, since the company was sold a few yrs back and it's CRAP NOW! Okay he didn't say crap that's My words> his where a wee bit nicer.  Yet he tired of pets coming in sick from eating Blue Buffalo! So here the kicker thought since I paid so much for the bag my 13 year old (stomach of steel) could eat it. Within 24 hours he has diarrhea. Now I'm counting back to my baby girl having gut issues and it's not long after the company was sold! Be careful people!

We purchased this product because there were so many good reviews on Amazon.  We have 3 golden retrievers.  The oldest, about 8 years old has suffered from Pancreatitis.  She has recovered and we selected this food because of its low fat content and reviews about helping dogs with digestive issues.  We have been making home made food for our dogs but with 3 it was just too much work.  We chose the healthy weight product for this dog and the Lamb and Rice for adult dogs for the other two.After one week on this food, our Golden Retriever started to wobble and seemed week in the back legs.  After 10 days she could not even walk!!!!!  I started doing research and there are LOTS of comments and reviews on Amazon and other sources about issues with this food, many of which are related with not begging able to walk.  I can not understand why a product with such pervasive issues can still be on the market.  Blue Buffalo should be removed form the shelves, because it is DANGEROUS for your animals.We have cancelled the subscription we set up, and will be working very hard to regain the health of our family pet.

He started on the puppy formula and progressed to adult formula. His poop was a little yellow and sometimes loose, so I switched him the BB's Limited Ingredient recipe that had lamb to see if that had an effect. I think chicken just isn't something his body handles in larger quantities (treats with chicken do not seem to impact him much), but that isn't the food's fault. Transferring to lamb basically instantly work for him. So, before you blame the brand, give either another protein a shot or try their grain-free or limited options. I try to keep my dog and a fairly monitored diet and preferred limited ingredient items. I did order this using Prime and as a one-time purchase. I do not advise buying food related items from a third party seller, but I have never had an issue with Prime items. The package arrive undamaged and no bug issues.

Found a very low carb dogfood online which is even more expensive then this stuff.  But I'm willing to give it a try, she's getting older and it is hard to control her weight. For the price and the way everyone praises Blue Buffalo I expected better, this stuff is trash.  She exercises every day and is still very active.  But this food is just loaded with carbs and If I keep her on it I know she will have serious health issues.  If I cut her down to a half a cup she's going to keep crying because she's hungry, never buying this brand again.Update: After taking her off the Blue Buffalo and putting her on a new brand ""Ketonatural"" which I think is a fairly new business.  Regardless, she lost a large amount of weight in just a week.  She developed a layer of fat from the Blue Buffalo that you could feel with your hands and was obviously unhealthy.  The fat is almost completely gone and she is loving the stuff.  Only downside is the price, it was $120 for a 24lb bag and $100 for a 16lb.

Then this week he develop a rash/yeast infection and started shaking from side to side. He's breathing pattern has change, the rashes on his chest and shoulder are so bad he can hardly lay down or sleep. He sits most of the time during the day and at night. It breaks my heart seeing him this way. He was also lethargic and slow moving all day long (this is an extremely active and fast moving dog, and slow movements is out of character for him). When you touched him, he would yelp in pain. We are at the vet right now couldn't wait to write this review. Shame on you Blue Buffalo with this hype about ""holistic life protection"" bull caca.

I generally find no quality in reading other people’s subjective take on this food. Really can a human be subjective when it comes to dog food? Isn’t the dog the only one that can be subjective? Okay so with that out of the way, I appreciate everyone’s negative feedback regarding this food. I understand that it does take time to write these things and put in the mental currency needed to write a good one. So now to my “objective” review of how my dogs seem to like this food. They all LOVE it. I have all three of my dogs on it - my oldest is an 11 yr old boxer with renal failure (she’s on prescription wet food, the Rx dry food is insanely expensive), another is a 6 yr old Boston Terrier that got to be a little chubby so I was looking for her to lose some weight (and with this food she has!) and the last little guy is my newest pup: he’s a 1.5 yr old Brussels Griffon that LOVES to eat everything! (And get loves to eat this food! I’ve had to buy him one of these weird bowls that look like a puzzle just to get him to slow down eating it.)I’ve never noticed any change in production quality, every bag that I’ve received has had a seemingly equal part of their “bits” or whatever they call them. I do mix this with a little bit of wet food for the two smaller pups and quite a bit for my medium-sized aging boxer.So to conclude, don’t listen to the reviews; listen to your dogs! My boxer has always had a sensitive stomach - in fact she was on sensitive stomach Rx dry food before the whole Renal failure hit - and she has not had a single reaction to this food.They have all been chowing down on this food for almost 8 months now I want to say. So yeah it’s Blue Buffalo, it’s quality, don’t let your own “dog-like precocious” feelings vicariously attach to the dog. Because as humans, it’s easy to see “what we want to see” in our dogs!",False

I started switching him over to Blue Buffalo a couple days ago, mixing half a portion in with his original food. He started getting a bit more sluggish, but we thought nothing of it, thinking he just needed some time to adjust to the switch. He also wouldn't eat the food for long periods of time. He is a picky eater, so again, we thought nothing of it. Now, today, we can barely get him to move.There is clearly something wrong with this food.

Side note Blue Buffalo is suffering a scandal right now that they were adding some kind of meal to their ingredients rather than their claim of real meat being the first ingredient. I don't believe even the high-end dog foods are adding real meat, even though they claim it's chicken beef pork fish I believe we're really getting the by products like lungs intestines cartilage etc. The real meat is going for human consumption at $7 a pound. How can they put real meat in this dog food along with the other binders and fillers process it all and then sell it for $2 a pound? It's like that fast food restaurant that claims 100% beef patties. Don't let that fool you 100% beef can still contain 30% fat, because fat is still considered beef,  part of the cow. They didn't claim 100% lean! There is always this sleight of hand advertising that will trick the mind into thinking you've got something you didn't get. I always get a good chuckle out of other reviews that claim their dog was poisoned by certain foods, or their dog will only eat certain foods , these are the same dogs who probably eat their own excrement and being a dog I guarantee they're licking themselves all over everywhere and probably the owners face as well, yet the owner wants to claim one dog food is better  than another?  Unless he  tasted it, ate it for some time and actually built muscle  and energy  and a shiny coat of hair on himself  I would have to contend  the owner  has no clue whether this dog foods is beneficial or not.

After finding an insanely good deal on Amazon, we went with Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula and my mind was blown.  Jolene is scarfing down her food within minutes at meal time, instead of leaving most of it in the bowl.  This morning, she whined for more (she had already gone 1/2 cup over her per meal time serving, so she didn't get it since we need her to maintain her health) and actually tried to pull and push my husband over to the closet where her food is kept.

I highly recommend this food my dogs have done great on it and they changed right over with not having runny stools. Again I had to recommend this food but the one with grain free not the one that’s grain free they have found that grain free is affecting some dogs brains and killing them.  If you prefer to have a grain free food blue also makes that that I feed my dogs the one with the brain and I highly recommend it,True

Didn’t touch it the whole day breakfast or dinner. The next day his stomach was audibly rumbling, but he still wouldn’t eat it. I fed him some wet food and he attacked it. I tried again with the Blue Buffalo , and this time he did eat a little. But later vomited. I was very concerned he had a blockage or other ailment. I read some reviews here that showed other people had some issues with spoiled Blue Buffalo from Amazon. For a test, I went out to Petsmart and bought a bag of the exact same brand and recipe. Boom!! He’s been eating it like always. No issues. So clearly the bag I bought from Amazon was spoiled. I’m very disappointed and hope there is no permanent damage to my dogs system. Please beware of this.

But, hey, it's Blue Buffalo right?A month or so ago our one dog started having minor seizures along with some vomiting and diarrhea.  Took him to the vet and some of his blood work was off (liver/pancreas) so they started running tests.  Several weeks (and much expense) later, they had no explanation for his condition.  He then refused to touch the Blue Buffalo food but would take other food presented to him.  On a side note, our other dog was also having some vomiting and diarrhea issues during this period.The more research I did some type of toxin was looking like a possible cause.  I then Googled Blue Buffalo and ""sick dogs"" and was amazed at the results.  Consumer Affairs website is loaded with complaints and they have a 2 star rating with them.  Tons of sick dogs reports.... mostly vomiting, diarrhea, etc.  I've even read of quite a few deaths.We've placed both of them on a different high quality dry food and our sick dog is already looking and acting better.  Hopefully his blood work will show improvement but it's too early to tell.  I'll try to post an update when we have additional information but we're tossing a brand new 38 lb bag (that one from a wholesale club).Please read the numerous reviews just on Amazon of dogs becoming ill from this food.  It's obviously not all bags but something is very wrong and this company has had quality control issues previously from contaminated food.Update:  After being on the new food for about 5 days, both dogs are apparently back to full health (including liver function).",True

Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe

He stopped eating at one point because of this, and we had to hand feed him his kibble one-by-one (which took FOREVER)!  After getting his teeth cleaned and speaking to the vet, they recommended mixing his food with soft/wet canned food.  Luckily, Blue Buffalo also makes canned food, and I purchased the 

Chicken Dinner with Garden Vegetables

  .  We start feeding Babu quarter-of-a-cup of kibble and mixed it in with the soft/wet canned food.  The canned food made the kibble a bit softer and more manageable on Babu's teeth.

I thought she must have eaten something outside and gave it a couple of days. When there was no improvement I remembered the reviews. I discontinued the food and cooked her extra of my food. Within 24 hours all was normal again. I opened the second bag of food from Amazon the next day. Within hours she was sick again. I went out and bought a different brand and fed her that for a week. No problems. Then bought the Blue Buffalo again from the local distributor and still everything was fine. There was clearly something wrong with the Blue Buffalo food sold on Amazon. Either it was counterfeit or mishandled. I tried to save a few dollars but threw away over $50 worth of food!

When I asked my vet how this could be, she asked what food I have been feeding her, and when I told her Blue Buffalo, she immediately said that it causes these crystals. I am grateful that we caught it. I had no idea and so hopefully this review will lead others to STAY AWAY FROM BB!!!

The vet and I assumed it was a reaction to the procedure and we tried to manage it with steroids and probiotics.For 6 months my dog was miserable having to urinate all the time from the steroids and having uncontrollable bowel movements frequently. My vet and I were doing everything we could think of because my dog was running out of gas and didn't have much left in him.In a loss for anything else to try I switched him back to Science Diet Lamb and Rice and within a week he was cleared up and we discontinued all the other treatments. He no longer has swollen bowl syndrome but does have a severe allergy to whatever was in the Blue Buffalo food.Be warned, changing foods can cause problems, even if you think you are upgrading to something better.

People are fixated on getting significant nutritional supplementation for themselves, translating this into needs for their pets as well.  The reality is that canines evolved on rather poor diets and heavily supplemented foods are not really good for our animals.  One of the issues he and other vets is seeing is bone pain and types of arthritis.  He did not go into the suspected pathology but indicated that there is some pretty good evidence that this is being associated with the high nutrition diets that are all the fad right now.

She started chewing furiously all herself all over her body and eventually she would smell the kibble and walk away which she never does. At first I thought maybe fleas or mange or something of the sort but after getting her checked out nothing was wrong with her in that sense.I inspected her food and it definitely smelled different than before. I decided to check the reviews on Amazon and saw similar complaints... well I dumped out the entire bag and decided to grab a small bag of the same brand and flavor and what do you know, she ate it like she hadn't seen food in forever.I smelled the new bag of blue buffalo that I purchased from the store and it didnt smell bad at all unlike the one I got from amazon.A few days after feeding her the bag from the store she already had major improvement in her mood and appetite and her hair started growing back. No more biting like crazy either.Needless to say I canceled my amazon subscribe and save and will be getting it from the store from now on.

Then with the last couple bags we received he started have bloody loose stools.  We changed his food and the problem went away, but we kept feeding the Blue Buffalo to our hound mix with the grain allergy.  Everything seemed good until we opened the most recent bag we received and the hound started having bloody, loose stools.  As we had seen this before with our beagle we immediately switched our hound to another food and the problem went away.I don't know if this is a quality control issue, changing of source ingredients or something else but I will no longer be using this food and will not recommend it to anyone.I've switched my dogs to ranchers choice from the local agriculture supply store.  Not only is it half the price but both my dogs eat without hesitation and they are noticeably more energetic.",True

Vet thinks its from mold in her food. ****Our dog right now is on a IV at the vets and they are trying to keep her alive. She has been very sick since consuming the last bag of Blue that came from Amazon two weeks ago....If you read on you’ll find that other dogs and their owners are experiencing the same thing. I really hope that Blue Buffalo will refund our vet bill because they can in no way give our dog her life back if we loose her.I’ve received five emails from Amazon since 6:30 PM last night. I’ll post a picture of that below as to save anyone else from going though what we are.My dog has eaten this exact food for maybe six years without any issues and we always order from Amazon so I’m not certain what happened with this batch. You can also read consumer affairs the reports from the last 2 to 3 weeks about this food to be the same as the complaints here on Amazon. For whatever reason this food is making some dogs very very ill. Are started with vomiting, losing weight, being lethargic and then blood in her stool. Are smaller dog ate about a half of a handful of it and became sick as well, not the food we normally feed him so he was switched back over instantly.....Don’t risk it!!! Of course we tried to call the blue Buffalo number and they won’t be open again for phone calls until Monday and I got that email after they were already closed on a Friday night :(Younger dog may bounce back more quickly but due to my dogs age they aren’t sure she is going to pull through. She has jaundice and her liver is not working properly...She was a perfectly healthy dog before eating this last batch of food.",True

My dogs only eat grain free Blue Buffalo Basic, and I was looking for a different flavor from this line, but I bought this specific bag by accident. Every single time we’ve tried slowly introducing a different brand dog food, grain free or not, my Frenchie has an instant, horrible allergic reaction with intense itching and he’s covered in breakouts that have to be medically treated for days after discontinuing use of the food. I’m pretty convinced I’ve actually created the allergy issue by only feeding him grain free food from a puppy, also because a milder version of this experience also happens now to our other dog that was a 14 month old rescue with no known allergies when we got her, and I’m certain the Humane Society as wonderful as they are, were not providing the dogs with grain free food lol, but that’s another topic. I had every intention on returning this bag and getting the correct one but my boyfriend didn’t realize it and already fed it to our 4 dogs. After I realized they had been eating it for 2 days, I noticed that our Frenchie only had a very mild visible allergic skin reaction I had to search for, but he didn’t display any discomfort or agitation. None of our other dogs showed any skin irritation or digestive issues after eating this food, like they would with another brands grain free food. I still switched them back to the Blue Buffalo Basic, but now it makes me wonder if they are just a reaction to grains, or if it’s something else that’s in other brand dog food they’re reacting to, if the reactions are from the other brands having lower quality ingredients than Blue Buffalo, or something I haven’t thought of. Either way, Blue Buffalo grain free or with grains have only ever proven to be an amazing pet food brand with products that I can trust and I will be forever loyal to.The flavor from this Blue Buffalo line of dog food specifically, my dogs and I were very happy with and I would highly recommend.",False

It was Kirkland turkey and sweet potato which had been fine for years. Maybe they changed their formula, I dunno. She was going outside to go poop 5 or 6 times a day, minimum. She used to go just twice a day, after breakfast and after dinner. Plus, it was like soft serve ice cream, mushy and hard to pick up. And clearly her bottom was irritated, she was licking it a lot. Super gross, all the way around.So I decided to try this Blue formula. I used to have a cat with health problems that did really well on the Blue brand so trying it for my dog was an easy decision. We started with a 25/75 new/old food ratio and by the time we were 50/50 I noticed a difference. Her poops were more solid and there were less of them. It is day 1 of just this new food now. She has been out to go potty twice, and only pooped right after breakfast, and I am thrilled! Again, TMI but it is harder, drier poop. Easier to pick up and doesn't smell as gross either.Even though it is spendier than the Costco food, ordering thru Amazon was cheaper than any local store's sale price and I love that it came to my door, rather than me schlepping it in and out of a cart, my car and up the stairs to my place.

I do not buy this product strictly from Amazon, so I don't think it's necessarily an issue with them. Furthermore, our other two dogs seemed to be unaffected. So, there is no guarantee that the reaction occurred from this food, but we are switching her away to be safe.My two female boxers really enjoy this food and are doing great with it. Our pups previously ate this formula. However, after some bad press we heard about this brand, we switched them to Taste of the Wild.

High Quality. Great Price. Keep reading for a short intro to Cold and Hot proteins.,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NAQGCJCWSLJO/,"I really like the Blue Buffalo brand. I work for a small pet feed store and even with my 20% discount at work, I get a better deal here. We currently feed the Whitefish and brown rice flavor.  I read another review where the reviewer stated that the bag they received from Amazon did not have a pungent fish aroma like bags bought elsewhere. FYI  If you purchase the fish flavor, it should NOT smell strongly of fish. When you get the strong fishy smell, that is because the fish oils in the product have turned rancid.  Fish oils can turn rancid pretty quickly, so if you receive a bag that has no odor, trust that you have gotten a very fresh bag. A slight fish odor is normal. Slight being the key word here. It should not be overpowering.On to flavor choices. When choosing a flavor or meat source for your dog food, you need to first consider whether your dog needs a ""hot"" protein or a ""cold"" protein based on their specific health needs/personality.  This subject can get very deep and intricate, so it is highly recommended to learn and investigate to fully understand the subject. Food has intrinsic properties that can help balance bodily energy. So dogs who tend toward an overbalance of “hot” energy should consume cooling foods, while those who tend to be ""cold"" in nature should consume warming foods.For example, my lab suffers from anxiety (hot energy). We used to feed the lamb formula, knowing nothing about hot or cold proteins at the time. As it turns out, lamb is one of the hottest proteins available. This was actually making his anxiety worse. We worked with a trainer who suggested switching the flavor of food we fed and gave us information about hot and cold proteins.  By switching his food to the Whitefish flavor, which is cooling, we have seen a drastic improvement in his anxiety levels. Sometimes I am still in awe as to how something as simple as switching the main source of protein in his diet has helped him so much. This also goes for many dogs with allergies, the flavor you are feeding could be the culprit!If you are switching from another brand of food, please take your time and acclimate your dog or puppy slowly! Blue Buffalo is very rich in protein so it is important that you switch your dogs food gradually from his current food to avoid digestive upset or tummy trouble. (This goes for all brands, not just switching to Blue) To transition, mix your dog’s current food with his new food. Over 7 days, gradually decrease the amount of the current dog food while increasing the amount of new dog food. Using this method for transitioning, I have had great results.

(the food got two shapes. Light-brown triangle and dark-brown ball bits.) He leaves those little brown balls in the plate.2. My dog started to have discharge from his eyes. This happens when he eats LOW quality food.3.

I'm not sure if it's as great as they make it seem but I know my girls won't eat anything but this! My older dog grew up eating pedigree or the cheap stuff but after getting a second dog I knew I needed to switch things up and get them the best so here we are. After switching my older dog is hooked! For $50 a bag it can get pricey but it is definitely worth it. A couple months back I didn't have the money to buy this bag so I got a bag of pedigree and they would not touch it! Idk if they knew the difference in the food or just got spoiled with the good stuff but I had to go out the next day and get this bag.. I did find that it is cheaper to get it from amazon as opposed to Petco or Petsmart. I've checked both stores and even though I'm a rewards member at both places amazon still sells is for roughly $10/15 cheaper.,True

If she doesn't like a food she just sniffs her bowl and walks away and she'll starve herself for days.

A few weeks ago our Vet said that she was getting a little chunky and I've been following the directions on the Purina package to the letter (Lady is 1 year old so she is very energetic and she gets a good amount of exercise and she NEVER gets people food) so he said we needed to switch foods because that was the likely culprit.Tried this Blue Buffalo and she adores it!",True

Luna is a female golden only 5 months old. We have been giving her this food from the day we brought her home. About a month ago some weird stuff started happening to her, it started with a rash, kind of like pimples on her belly and behind/in her ears. We took her in to the vet and the vet gave us antibacterial shampoo to bathe her in. It didn't do squat. Then she started to vomit occasionally, I just thought it was her being a dumb puppy eating stuff she shouldn't. Then came the diarrhea, she couldn't control it, not fun to clean mind you. After getting concerned I started reading reviews on another website on blue buffalo. I found out they were taken to court for false advertisement by Purina after Purina tested their food to see if it really contained the ingredient they claimed. Well it didn't, it contains more (meal) than most other pet foods. Then I find out they out sourced manufacturing to China so who knows what they put in the food now. Back to my dog not wanting to eat her food, she wouldn't touch the food, Luna is the kind of dog that would eat your hand if it was in the bowl while she was eating so I know she isn't picky. So I went and bought another brand of food to test my theory and other peoples as well. I put some in her food dish and she still wouldn't touch it! After reading a bit more someone had the same issue except the next time they put it in a different dish so it wouldn't have the same smell as the blue buffalo food and their dog ate it right up. So I tried the same thing and she ate no problem. The symptoms are gone but I sure as well will never use BB or recommend it to anyone else again. I felt I should share this story for other people experiencing the same problems, mind you not every person is having these issues but there are lots that are.",False

It does not contain any by-product meal, corn, wheat, or artificial flavors.The kibble size ranges from the size of an eraser to about the size of a nickel.

My dog is around 25 pounds and eats a cup of food in the morning and night. This will vary between owner because of different breeds and schedules. Basing your decision off of my dog and schedule I hope it helps you decide which size would be best for your dog.Many users may be skeptical to purchase Blue Buffalo because of the price, but I would say it is well worth it. I have often found Blue Buffalo food on sale or coupons in store advertisements. I would recommend shopping around to ensure the best deal on this product.I have found my dog to love this dog food. He has been fed this from puppy to his current age of two.

I have a Yorkie- Maltese who began throwing up at least once a day for this entire month. I couldn't wrap my head around why this was happening. He's 11 years old, an older dog, and I had researched he may need to eat less and more often throughout the day to keep him from throwing up and having his stomach empty. It seemed to help at first, but even when he was being fed more often he was still throwing up yellow foam. I also have a german shepherd/retriever mix and he has been itching non-stop and his skin has been irritated and red.I've been looking more closely into the reviews for this product and down to even they way the online brand kibble looks (pale and stale looking) to being store bought (darker colored) there has to be something happening with the online products of this brand. I know that Blue brand is a highly recommended dog food with better ingredients than the grocery store brands of dog food, but I definitely recommend you doing your research before purchasing this brand online. There are so many reviews saying it caused their dogs skin irritation and vomiting and I have witnessed this first hand. Both of my dogs, even the 11-year-old Morkie, are in perfect health with no prior skin irritations or health dificiencies.I recommend purchasing this brand in stores and NOT ONLINE. There are other brands on here that have better reviews that you should look into. I've already ordered the Diamond Brand dog food found here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BVUBBPG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I know purchasing good dog food in a 30 pound (or really any quantity) can be expensive and I am all for purchasing online, but DO YOUR RESEARCH!

Our vet couldn't find the cause and suggested to switch foods.  We'd been feeding Merrick & Merrick's cheaper brand Whole Earth Farms for years, never thinking it was the food since his potty time was always fine & other than the skin issues he was in great health.  Being so sick & tired of his poor skin problems I gave Blue Buffalo a shot & I gave it several bags before I made a decision as to if it was helping at all or doing nothing.  I figured the food would probably have nothing to do with any of the skin issues and was just taking a shot in the dark picking Blue Buffalo.  I was absolutely shocked that his skin issues are totally 100% gone now - all cleared up & 100% healed!  Now I do want to be super clear here & state that I honestly believe it was the removal of his old food that was what caused this amazing improvement, not the addition of Blue Buffalo.  Hope that makes sense!I mean that, I think any other good quality food would have very likely caused improvement in his skin issues.  I just happened to choose Blue Buffalo & it just happened to work great for us!  It's good quality nutrition, our Aussie seems to like the taste, it's always available here on Amazon & if for some reason I don't want the Chicken & Rice at any point there are plenty other varieties to choose from.  I really love when pet food companies have various kinds & flavors so we can keep our dog's digestive system regular & give him some variety to keep him excited about food!  We can switch between any of the varieties without any fuss because most of them have very similar ingredients. The biggest positive I can report is, we didn't transition him at all from his old food to Blue Buffalo.  So we were expecting some not-so-great potty results.  Nope!

But as weeks progressed I noticed a terrible turn in his stool and his mood. I also noticed he wouldn't eat the food once a put it down, he would leave the food untouched for 2 to 3 days at a time. That's when I started to do more research. I started to compensate with Purina, but that only work for a week or so and it was back to unhealthy stool, lack of eating, downtrodden mood, and even vomiting. I started giving him peeled boiled potatoes, unseasoned white rice, and egg yolk just to put something in his belly. One day I was at home and clear as day I thought ""Blue Buffalo"" I know it was the LORD speaking to me because I had never inquired or researched this specific product. I didn't hesitate, nor did I speculate. I jumped on Amazon and ordered this product which arrived 2 days later. Jackson (my blue nose pit) dove head first into his dog dish leaving no remainings. At first I thought maybe because he really liked it as he does most dog food upon initially trying it. But then I noticed a dramatic change in his stool, in his weight and in his behavior. I waited to see if any bad symptoms would reoccur but nothing happened. Jackson is well and loves his food. 15 pound will last a month and 30 pounds will last 2 months. I still give him the white rice and egg yoke occasionally. Rice puts more weight on him and egg yoke shines his coat something wonderful. Overall, Great dog food.

  . He gobbled up the chicken and brown rice flavor right away. I noticed the following benefits within the first week of feeding him this:1. Noticeable energy - he is up and running around a little more than usual. He also has a more lively look in his eyes.2. Appetite - his appetite neither went up nor down, but I have noticed that he loves this food. At first he ate about a half to a full cup more than I normally give him, but that tapered back down to his normal amount by the end of the first week.3. Digestion - I have purchased both the regular and small bite pellet sizes, and he digests the small bite pellets better. He has had many teeth removed, so I have noticed that the small bite formula is easier on his gums and teeth.Overall, I highly recommend this food.

When we first got our sweet little girl, she was already two years old and had lived a rough life with not the best care or food.  We were told that she was fed a store brand generic food, which she would gobble down as fast as she could when it was in front of her.  After a few weeks we started having issues with our new family member, it seemed like every other day she was having a seizure which usually occurred a few hours after her food was eaten.  After numerous vet appointments the suggestion was made to give her a better food, so after quite a bit of research we settled on Blue Buffalo.  I am happy to say that we have now had our Baby Girl for 5 years and we have been seizure free since the switch.  I can honestly say you get for what you pay for in this case, she has more energy, her coat looks 100% better, and she no longer gobbles down her food, but enjoys it throughout the day. I highly recommend Blue to anyone that has a dog or cat, its simply one of the best foods on the market.  Thank You Blue for helping our little girl and making her a permanent part of our family.",True

My dog got major food allergies and I had to spend over $500 to help him recover. When I first bought it I was so glad that it was much less than the store price and as he started to eat it he started to nibble on his feet alot and then it just started getting worse and was tearing the skin off all 4 of his feet. I took him to the vet and had to do multiple testing to figure out what exactly the problem was. Then the vet said it was most likely food allergies and I had to put him on a veterinary diet that pretty much healed him with multiple rounds of medications. After some time I decided to look at and read the packaging of this product a little more. I noticed that the package was completely different and I assumed since it was coming from some other location that it was different. Then I started to notice that the food even looked a little different. The pebbles were a different size than the one you can buy at Petsmart as well. This is a replica of the original Blue Buffalo brand and I couldn't believe that it was endorsed by them. I'm beginning to wonder if I should even continue using Blue Buffalo brand because it is so hyped up by the media. There are many other brands that are far better than blue buffalo and more natural and safe. I am not recommending buying dog food from any online store because you really don't know where its coming from and where it's made. At least you know you can return it at a pets store if you buy it from there without having to pay return shipping or pay any restocking fees. If you really care about your dog and if you really don't care about your dog (maybe you shouldn't have one) then get what's best for them because they are innocent creatures and all they want to do is make you happy and you are the most important thing to them in this world.,True

We had all our dogs and cats changed to BB in about Nov. so it has been almost 3 months. We now have decided to change food because our dogs and cats stopped using the potty regularly. Just a few days ago we took one cat to the vet and she had a UTI combined with swollen/inflamed bowels. Never had we had problems before, until BB. I didn't want to wait until any of my other cats or dogs got sick so we just threw out all the BB food. I had read the bad reviews here on amazon but I didn't think that such a well known brand of food could be bad. I figured the reviews were probably just lies to try and sway people to another brand, or that maybe it was just a coincidence that certain pets got sick-not because of BB.

I have always been conscientious of the food I get for my dogs, but I had noticed that over the winter their coats had a lot of visible dander and were just overall dull. After the week on Blue Buffalo there were visible improvements to their coats and I decided to purchase a bag of my own when I returned home. While the cost might put some off initially, I can attest as an owner of 3 40+ lb dogs, that due to the high quality of the food you actually feed your dogs less and they get more in the way of nutrients than less expensive brands. Overall, six months on, the dogs' health has improved and I am very satisfied with this product.***Update***I used Blue Buffalo for several months until my dogs all became inexplicably ill - not eating, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, shakes, and general distress. After trip to ER vet (at a great cost with 3 dogs), I was told to put them on a bland diet for 3-5 days and slowly reintroduce their food. The hypothesis from the vet was that they may have gotten into ""something"", but whatever it was, it was not lethal. Followed the prescription diet and then slowly reintroduced Blue Buffalo and WHAM! all three were experiencing the same symptoms as before. Another trip to the ER and the vet suggested it might be the food and to take them off it completely. I did and am happy to say several years later - all of which the dogs have been on Costco's Kirkland brand - we have had zero bouts of intestinal distress. Granted, I may have just gotten a ""bad"" bag, but with my dogs, I am not willing to risk it.",True

After visiting my dad over the weekend, he gave me a bag of this stuff because his dog wouldn't touch it. I went online and read the reviews, including a lot of the negative ones. I was skeptical, and held off on it for a little while. Then one afternoon, I was about to feed my dog before heading off to work when I realized we were pretty much out of dog food (I didn't realize earlier because my fiance and I alternate feeding the dog). I figured that there were so many positive reviews, it was most likely a few bizarre cases where dogs got sick, and it may have even been from something else. I gave him a scoop, and left for work. When I got home, all of my concerns were immediately validated. My dog had horrible diarrhea, was throwing up, and was extremely listless and shaking.If you read through the ingredients in this food, most of it really seems fine, but I can promise you that it's not. I don't know if it's due to some kind of product mishandling, or other unlisted ingredients, but there's a reason this stuff has so many bad reviews. I wish I had listened to the negative reviews, despite them being drastically outweighed by the positive ones. A quick Google search will show you some of the horrible things associated with this product - shakes, tremors, seizures, digestion issues, and in several cases death. You know it's a problem when an extremely hungry dog won't touch it. I'm not a dog expert. I've only had my dog for a few months, and I'm still learning a lot. I am by no means a dog food snob, and really only tried this overpriced dog poison because my father tried to do the right thing for his dog and bought him the ""good"" food. There's nothing wrong with the $13 bag of Purina puppy chow at the grocery store. Save your money and your dog's life.",False

The fish mix straightened her out. She was on it for three months, until a few days ago, when she had an OD reaction to the vitamin supliment in the food. How do I know? Simple. BB consists of two types of kibble, the triangular meat and vegetable portion and a dark round supplemental nugget portion. The ratio of one to the other is usually something like 95% to 5% meat kibble to supplemental nugget. This bag consisted of more than 60% supplemental nugget. I should have known  better but I trusted BB to not let a bad mix out of the factory. My dog had a toxic reaction - heavy salivating, drooling, discomfort - a few hours after dinner. I returned the bag of fish and potato and picked up a bag of BB lamb and rice. Before walking out of the store I opened the bag and checked the ratio. Looked normal. fed it to dog. No problems.

Assuming that it was because of him being a puppy, his hygiene wasn’t the best. Was put on antibiotics and Hills food for 10 days. The crystals cleared up. Then on Oct 17th of this years, he developed severe diarrhea and was vomiting. I gave him an Imodium and withheld food that night. The Next morning I fed him a small amount of food and within 15 mins. he threw that up too.  We were out of town at the time, so I had to take him to a vet I knew nothing about. Luckily Brewer Vets in Springfield, IL were great. I immediately had them do an xray because this is a dog that was known to swallow rocks and it was the exact same symptoms. Xray showed he had several pockets of gas in his stomach and intestines. All his blood work and vitals were normal. The vet thought that maybe the stress from traveling caused it. Although we were only 2 ½ hrs. from home and Joey had slept the entire way there. Joey stayed at the vets for the day to make sure he did not become more dehydrated, then started him on Flygal and Hills food for 5 days. After a few days of this I put him back on BB. The diarrhea did not clear up and he was vomiting yellow phlegm in the morning about every 1 or 2 days.At the same time that all this started with Joey, Frankie, who is 10 yrs., started drinking water excessively and peeing a lot. Took another stool sample of Joey’s and a urine sample of Frankie’s to my vets about 4 days later. Joey’s stool sample was negative and Frankie’s urine showed a very high PH count. Joey had also started drinking large amounts of water. More lab work done on Joey and also on Frankie. Both came back normal. We thought that maybe Joey had become allergic to chicken, so I bought a bag of BB fish & potato. Another 10 day round of Flygal and Hills food for 3 or 4 days for Joey and antibiotics for Frankie. After 2 weeks, Frankie had crystals in his urine and Joey still had Diarrhea. My vet put Frankie on a different antibiotic and Hills food for 2 weeks. Frankie has always gone to the bathroom 4 to 6 times a day and at least 1 time would be a soft stool. After 2 or 3 days on the Hills food, Frankie stopped drinking as much and going to the bathroom as often, and not one was diarrhea. Kind of made the light bulb go off.  Frankie’s urine sample yesterday still shows his PH is high but the crystals are gone. Started reading all the reviews about Blue Buffalo and was amazed at how many dogs had the same symptoms as Joey and Frankie. Switched all 4 of my dogs to Wellness dog food….no chicken in it either. Within 2 days Joey’s stools were almost normal again. 3 dogs I switched over cold turkey and Joey in 1 ½ days. Not 1 of them even had soft stools from switching so fast.Both Joey and Ranger, 1 of my other dogs kept licking and chewing their butt every time they went to the bathroom. This stopped after switching food too.At the time all this started, both Joey and Ranger were only getting ¾ cup of BB. In the morning they got raw chicken backs and freeze dried raw food. At night they got BB and ¾ cup freeze dried raw. I don’t even want to think what might have happened to Joey if he had eaten only BB. Frankie and Leeah were getting straight BB. Lucky for me Leeah never got sick since she is 12 yrs old and wouldn’t have bounced back as fast as Joey.It’s too bad that Blue Buffalo doesn’t spend some of their money on trying to figure out what’s wrong with their food instead of so much on advertising trying to convince people how good their dog food is. Even better, maybe they could pay my vet bills which, at this point, amount to hundreds of dollars. I had been using BB for almost 2 yrs. and you can bet I’ll NEVER use it again.

They were always very dry, pebbly, crunchy and small.  Sometimes she would go multiple times when out walking in one day just to empty out her ""system"".  Sometimes she would go 2-3 days without pooing a nugget.  When she would go, it looked like she was having to put a monumental effort into it, with straining, grunting, eyes bugging out, etc.  Since this had been the norm all her life, and she certainly was never in a state of dehydration, we finally asked our vet what the deal was, and she pointed at the food.Enter Blue Buffalo.  After a very, very slow and successful acclimation process, things got much better (you really must do this over 6-weeks).  We never had any of the issues some folks in other reviews of mentioned of overly runny poo, diarrhea, etc.  What we did notice was that her poo became very consistent, regular, and she now poos something the size of a BUFFALO patty.  O.o  They are huge, a bit moist, tender and very fragrant now!  The straining and grunting is gone.  When she goes now, they just shoot out of her like a well oiled, long rocket exiting a missile silo.  You can also smell it from 20' away on an upwind breeze.  Just how you'd expect a fresh mound to be.  We are still shocked that something of that size could even emanate from a 12lb precious.We were a bit surprised at the size of the food itself.  We started with the small breed sized food and it was way to small.  The normal sized food was more on order of being comparable to the old food.  To give a comparison, the small breed size is about pea sized.  The regular is more like the size of irregular shaped, small marbles.  She liked the normal size much better, as she could actually feel like she had something to chew on, which is better for her teeth anyway.We have also noticed a significant improvement in her coat and skin.  She has long suffered from hot spots and dry skin patches that she would sometimes incessantly chew on.  We used to have to give her a medication from the vet (a form of steroid) to cool her skin at times during the summer to keep her from chewing herself raw in certain areas.  This has all disappeared!In summary, the food is great stuff, and has worked several wonders on our beloved Shih Tzu.  Hope it does the same for your fur babys!",False

My dad considered diet to be an integral part of keeping the dog's mind and body finely tuned for search and rescue work so he conducted a few trial months of various dog foods, monitoring changes in energy level, coat health, bowel movements, and general interest in taste.  Blue Buffalo performed the best.  My dad's dogs coat is now extremely plush with no dry flakiness he had when he was first adopted, at a very healthy weight with tons of energy, has had no illnesses whatsoever, and happens to thoroughly enjoy his meals.I adopted a dog for myself about 5 months ago.  The previous owner warned me of his having an sensitive and irritable stomach (prone to diarrhea and bloating) and being picky about foods. Because of that, they'd had him on some ridiculously expensive prescription foods.  He wasn't at a healthy weight and had dry itchy skin with excess shedding, and was a little lethargic.  I immediately switched him over to Blue Buffalo when I got him home, since it worked so well for my dad.  His skin has since totally recovered.  He hasn't had any bowel problems, even when I give him the occasional table scrap. He's now has a very sleek athletic body. And I get compliments all the time about how glossy and beautiful his coat is.  I swear by Blue Buffalo to keep my furry friend healthy, comfortable, and happy.Also, even though it's more expensive upfront than some other main brands, the food is so nutritious that he doesn't need to eat as much of it as he does the others, and it actually saves me money in the long term.",False

Current pet food regulations allow manufacturers to use ingredients that you would never knowingly give to your pet. In fact, you may be SHOCKED to learn what some companies are putting in their pet food! Take a look  at the video for further info: What's REALLY In Your Pet's FOOD??[...]Furthermore, we got him a companion dog in excellent health condition who was used to eating mainly dry food and we gave her some of this food and to determine whether this food just had an impact (or negative allergic reaction) on our first dog and whether she would be affected or not.  Sure enough, same first day she ate her first bowl of this Buffalo brand food, she had diarrhea and she even woke us up at 2am the first night because she could not hold it anymore. She had diarrhea 6 times in just 24 hours.  A side note on this dog, she has a strong stomach because prior to adopting her, the previous owners told us she eats just about anything from fruits, vegetables, different dry foods and her stomach does not get upset.After all this nightmare and realizing there is no quality at this Buffalo corporation,  we now have started to give them real organic food made by us since we could no longer trust these dog food companies and our older dog has immediately lost the weight he gained thanks to that disgusting, toxic and cheap food. If you have ever watch the movie ""Food Inc"" and have realized what food is available for human beings, just imagine what type of food these dog food Corporations are selling to our dogs (babies)!Now meal time with our home made food is their favorite time of the day, they absolutely love it and start jumping up and down something that never happened with any type of dry food.  Today to our surprise, we found out that THIS PRODUCT IS BEING RECALL FOR CONTAINING TOXIC INGREDIENTS. We are shocked that by giving them this Buffalo food, we were putting in great danger the lives of our beloved dogs.  If you really love your dog and he/she is truly part of your family, make him/her their own food to protect their health and life. Is really easy to make and does not take that much time.  There are books in Amazon that guides you through the food dogs should and should not eat. Now our dogs eat real chicken, brown rice, veggies, and a spoon of organic multi-vitamin which we mix it all together when serving.  This will not only make them happier, healthier, stronger, but also increase their lifespan.The info below will show you some of the reality and suffering of those who have fed their dogs with Buffalo food:truthaboutpetfood com /articles/more-worrisome-news-on-blue-buffalo-dog-food.html",True

He does eat anything he can find, like an old clif bar that he found on the side of the trail or a croissant that he grabbed out of the front seat of some guys car at the trail head, but grass was unusual. So I started researching the food I was feeding him, which was Science Diet active, and it is kind of a junky dog food. After hemming and hawing over what to feed him I decided to go with Blue Buffalo. It isn't off the Richter scale expensive, about 10 bucks more than the science diet, and the ingredient list is pretty good. It has changed his coat which is beautiful and soft, but he hasn't stopped munching on grass and he has insane gas thus the 4 stars. I am purchasing a second bag and we will see how it goes, but I am not too worried because he hasn't has diarrhea and has regular movements which is good for a neurotic dog.",True

I had been using Iams Weight Control for my two Cocker Spaniels.  I gradually transitioned from the Iams to BB.  As the transition progressed, my dogs appeared to be more hungry at each feeding.  As it turned out, I think that they were just starting to enjoy their food for the first time in their short little lives. Sad, really.  But how can a person tell if a dog food actually tastes good?  If I were to pick a dog food based on what I THINK might taste good, I would be feeding my dogs Beneful dog food (their commercials make ME hungry).  In any case, they seem to love BB.  So that's the review from the dog's point of view.As for how this change in dog food has impacted MY life.  I live on a half acre and my two cockers can really spread wealth, if you know what I mean.  I really like to keep the lawn ""bomb free"" so my kids and I pick-up the lawn often.  When the dogs were eating Iams, the ""surprises"" that they would create would lay softly beneath the top blades of grass, just waiting for someone to come step on them.  It was too often an ugly situation that I will not describe here.  Since we have been feeding the dogs BB, those ""duce-balls"" now sit lightly upon the TOP of the grass.  They are light, easy to see and very firm (Eauwwwww!) As a result, pick-up is quicker and the lawn is cleaner.I suggest you give this food a try, but be cautious.  Based on some reviews, BB has had some quality problems in the past.  Nobody wants to lose their animal due to negligence on the part of a dog food company.  As with any change in your dog's diet, monitor closely.  Even if a food is safe and healthy, not all foods agree with all animals.

Healthy Weight has 415 calories per cup and 3.290 calories/gram.  Compared to the Longevity line for adult dogs, Healthy Weight has more calories per cup but a fewer calories per gram, meaning that Healthy Weight has more grams per cup than Longevity. Looking at the order of ingredients (which is by pre-production ingredient weight), I am concerned that too much of Healthy Weight's protein may come from whole grains, which do not contain all of the amino acids that a dog must get from his or her food (dogs cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from plants and grains the way humans can.) De-boned chicken is the first ingredient, but, because it contains 75% water before processing, it is not the heaviest final ingredient.  Chicken meal is a high quality protein, but it is listed as the fifth ingredient.Also: At the bottom of this review I name a brand of food that ultimately helped me meet my dog's goals.Overview of Weight Control: While I did not do all I could to make Weight Control work for my dog, it ultimately did not help my dog reach his ideal weight. Blue Weight Control is nutrient rich, very low in fat, and uses high-quality protein sources. Unfortunately, Blue Weight Control has 444 calories per cup, which  is pretty calorie-dense.  I believe it was over 4 calories per gram, which, in human food, is the caloric density of cheddar cheese.  My dog may have been able to eat a satisfying quantity of this food if he only needed to maintain a healthy weight, but he needed to lose weight, and the portions I had to feed him were too small. Fortunately, Blue Buffalo makes an excellent food called 

Blue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag

  , and the adult food has a more reasonable 354 calories per cup, allowing my dog to eat a more satisfying quantity of food per day.Details: My dog weighed 50 lbs. and needed to get to the maximum ideal weight for his breed --44 lbs.-- as determined by my vet and the American Kennel Club.  According to several dog nutritionists, the calories a dog should consume per day to lose weight is computed as follows:  1)Convert his goal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2.  For my dog 44 lbs over 2.2= 20.  2  Multiply her weight in KG by 30.  For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog's case, that meant 670 calories per day.  This number represents the dog's caloric needs while on a weight loss diet, assuming the dog has no special needs, such as pregnant or whelping, being a puppy, being a toy breed, working, or living outdoors in cold weather. The formula only is valid if the dog weighs between 5 and 99 pounds. Check with your vet to make sure the daily calories you compute are in the right neighborhood.The reason Blue Weight Control was not the best Blue Buffalo food for my dog was because it is is relatively calorie dense-- 444 calories per cup. To feed him 670 total calories per day, I could only feed him 1.5 cups per day, meaning that each of his two meals could only be 3/4 cups, and that was without even a tiny buffer for a single green bean as a treat. (Later I explain why I had to add-in other foods.  I ended up only feeding him 2/3 of a cup for each meal, and that really worried me about the adequacy of his nutrition. This quantity of food is well below the feeding guidelines on the bag. My dog was miserable and begged constantly. He would even lick his empty bowl between meals.  I tried feeding him a 1/3 cup (10 calories) of plain no-added-salt canned green beans as a snack, just to help fill his stomach, but he was not content and eventually turned his nose up at the green bean snacks.  I should have added warm water to his dog food and stirred in the green beans, but I wasn't smart enough to do so at the time. My dog kept acting hungry and begging for more dog food.  He would actually walk over to the bag of dog food, put his paw on it, and look at me while whining softly! Other members of my household would sneak table food to him because he begged so persistently, and the ""diet"" was a abysmal failure.  My poor dog ended up actually gaining 4 more pounds from all the human cheating!I was glad I found Blue Longevity adult food.  It has 354 calories per cup as opposed to 444. It has 3.384 calories/gram.  I gave my dog 1.8 cups per day (in 2 meals) for 640 calories. A saleswomen at Petsmart explained that I could help increase my dog's feeling of fullness even more by adding warm water to to his food, enough to just cover the kibble, and letting it sit on the counter a minute so that the kibble would swell up. I should then stir in 10 calories (a little less than 1/4 cup) of no-added-salt green beans to make it an even more filling meal. I did all of these changes together, so I can't separate the effects. My dog stopped the whining and began to lose the weight.I budgeted him only 10 calories per day for treats. The problem was, I had to find something to give as a treat at least 3 times per day.  See, my dog lived in a no-kill shelter for 18 month, so I had to use treats to re-housebreak him. Now he refuses to do #2 unless he is guaranteed a treat (if he doesn't get one immediately after he goes, he lies down on the ground and makes us carry him home--even if we are two blocks from the house and it is dark and pooring down rain. Welcome to my world of loving an Australian Cattle Dog.) I was surprised to learn that small sized Milk Bones have 20 calories each and contributed to him getting overweight to begin with. Even breaking one in half wasn't enough to make his treat calories reasonable. I found a bite-sized treat that is only 1-2 calories called 

Premier Liver Biscoti Dog Treats, Original Recipe, Original Bite Size, 8oz. Bag

  ).  They were fine as a substitute for Milk Bones. I recently found a 2-calorie  treat that my dog is crazy about called 

Zuke's Mini Naturals Salmon Dog Treats

   (not to be confused with the 10-calorie each 

Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken N Cherryz, 16 oz

  . My dog would probably walk through fire for the Salmon flavored ones, but he also likes the peanut butter flavored ones.Update: I eventually found a web site called DogFoodAdvisor.com.  Through it, I found another food called 

Premium Edge Healthy Weight I Weight Reduction Formula Adult Dry Dog Food, 35-Pound

   that has the same calories per cup as Longevity but that has twice as much protein (also from high quality sources!) It is also grain-free (dogs don't need grains in their diet at all) and a little less expensive per pound.  It helped my dog build muscle and lose weight.",False

Well, I was happy to find that Blue Buffalo foods seemed to be tailored to exactly what I was in search of! In addition, my dog suffers from allergies and I had been supplementing her with Alaskan Salmon Oil for added Omega-3 and Omega-6.

Everything sounded wonderful! I placed my order and it arrived promptly. I tried getting her to eat the food for about a week or two before I decided it was a no go :( I tried mixing it with hot water for gravy...still, she never did take to it. She is typically a very accepting dog when new foods are introduced...however, with this food she was not.

She was lethargic for weeks before she began vomiting and had blood in her stool. We're careful to never let her into the garbage or anything toxic and we never feed her any human food, so we took her into the vet with the suspicion that maybe she had lodged something in her system from being outside on the lawn.The vet said she checked out fine, so we were clueless. A friend mentioned that his dog had similar symptoms before he changed her food. We thought there was no way a dog's food could cause such dramatic symptoms in a dog, and our dog was far from a picky eater, so we were a bit weary about the advice but we gave it a shot anyway since our dog was miserable. He recommended Blue Buffalo for its more natural ingredients, so that's the route we took.It has been over six months now and we haven't looked back. Phasing the new food in slowly, she stopped vomiting within days, and had considerably perked up within a week. Some days she has so much energy that it even surprises us. The only thing we did was change her food. Our educated guess was that she was having an allergic reaction to one or more of the synthetic ingredients in the Iams that we were feeding her.To us, the extra price paid to get Blue Buffalo is well worth it to feed our dog a more healthy food.",False

(This made national news. In case you aren't familiar with the story, I'm sure the news reports are archived online.) I didn't feel comfortable taking chances with the most helpless member of my family. Luckily, she switched to Blue Buffalo with minimal fuss. I've purchased the Chicken and Rice as well as the Lamb and Rice versions of the product and she loves both equally. However, she will not eat the versions (canned or dry) that contain a major amount of sweet potato, but she is a rather picky puppy. There is (for her) one small drawback with this food; she tends to eat around the ""Lifesource bits"" initially. Eventually though, she does come back to them.The most important part for me is that she's as healthy and as happy as she's ever been. Even at seven, she still plays like a puppy. At her last vet check (January 2011), the vet was thrilled at how great her teeth looked, praised the shine and texture of her coat (super shiny and soft as silk) as well as her high energy level. I write these comments because on the rare occasions that I've run out of her food and had to purchase another brand (other high end, vet recommended brands - my dog is very spoiled and always eats well), within two - three days her coat starts to dull and she doesn't seem as playful as is her norm.I'm sorry for the long review on dog food, but my Dobie is as much a part of my family as any of my human family. I'm extremely cautious of the food, treats, and chewy bones that I purchase for her. She has been, and continues to be the best of companions even if she is spoiled. This dog food is a bit more expensive than some others are, but to me it's worth it if it keeps her healthier longer.",False

He has suffered since he was about 6 months with terrible scratching.  He will chew on his paws, lick his legs, do the fancy 3-leg-standing belly scratch, and often would lay on the brick hearth and scrape his chin back and forth.  Needless to say, this would cause his skin to be red, raw, often broken, etc.  Hot Spots weren't really a problem, but we could tell he was miserable.  Ear infections plagued him for about 3-4 months repeatedly... The vet was no help - the did try to alleviate his symptoms, but never tried to find the source of the problem.  I decided after researching for a while, that a food allergy was to blame.  I eradicated all corn and chicken from his diet, as these are common Bulldog allergens in food.  I slowly switched him to Blue Buffalo Fish and Sweet Potato formula.Previously, he had been on Eukanuba adult maintenance formula.  I had raised many dogs in my life with this food formula, and they had led long and healthy lives.  With a proper, slow integration of food, he did not encounter any loose stools, and his itching has greatly subsided.  i have had him on this food now for 3 weeks, now eating only this food.Bulldogs are BIG chewers, so I traded all his chicken basted rawhides for beef basted rawhides, and changed from Milkbone treats to another one made from Cranberries and Oatmeal with NO corn or poultry products.He was tentative at first with the food change, as he would normally eat once a day around 4:30.

Well, to be entirely honest, they eat equal parts of Blue Buffalo and Natural Ultramix, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots, and apples - and an occasional can of Halo or Evanger's. So why do we include the Blue Buffalo?First, because it is made from the best ingredients - if you were going to make the stuff yourself, besides chicken, you'd probably include grains like brown rice, barley, oats and rye, (no wheat, corn or soy), and vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and sweet potatatoes, not to mention a few extras like blueberries, cranberries and, (I swear), green tea extract.Second, because they actually like it. And if you've got a finicky dog, you know what I'm talkin' about. Our Scotty will eat almost anything, (delicacy prevents me from going into any detail on this point), but our Westie? This is a dog for whom every bite is a thoughtfully considered proposition. Should I eat this? Hmmmmmm? Maybe not. Perhaps I should move it from my bowl to the living room carpet and contemplate it? Ah.... It's Blue Buffalo. I'll eat it.We generally buy the 6 pound bag - that means that we buy more frequently than we would if we were buying the larger sizes - but it's easier to store and stays fresher.Many people are concerned about feeding their dogs ""dry"" food - and to some extent, I share that concern. But when it's a quality product like Blue Buffalo and is fed as part of a ""menu"" that includes other fresh and healthy ""entrees,"" I think that it's an excellent addition to your dog's diet.[This is an up-date to my review: Economic times being what they are, something had to give - so a couple of months ago, we eliminated the Natural Ultramix from our terriers' diets. We also eliminated the canned foods, (my wife is convinced that even a small amount of canned food was contributing to our Scotty's tendency to put on a little extra weight). So we've been feeding them Blue Buffalo exclusively, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots and apples. This change has had no ill effects on their health or appearence - and they continue to love the stuff. I remain convinced that when it comes to kibble, Blue Buffalo is an outstanding product.]",False
