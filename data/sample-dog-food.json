            "review_text": "I bought into the marketing hype about how I'm a better dog mom for buying this food. My girl ate it over the course of 8-10 months. There were many times when I'd put it in her bowl and she'd look up at me as if to say, \"Ugh, isn't there anything else?\" This is a dog who will eat carrots, kale, rabbit poop, dog poop...so I know she's not picky. 😆  All the more reason to investigate when she doesn't like the taste of something.After keeping a poop journal ( because yes, I'm THAT dog mom and also poop tell us what's going on in the body) I realized that her poops were always progressively runny as the day went on. Every. Single. Day. We feed 3x a day and she poops about 3 or 4x per day. I always clean it up, so yeah...I notice the subtle changes in the consistency. The only poop that was 100% solid was the first one of the day. Then it would get softer and softer until it was so runny that we'd go on walks and I couldn't even bag it. Also, she's a long-haired breed, so THAT's been a joy to deal with. 🤮 🤮 🤮I switched to another brand...Wellness https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BORBHO...and holy 💩, ALL of her poops are ALL NORMAL. She also loves the taste of her new food. I love being able to pick it up after it comes out the other end. I love that I don't have to wash her entire back end after an especially messy poop. I will never buy anything from Blue Buffalo again.",

One thing to know about our Corgi is that she is picky. I've tried like 17 brands of treats and she only likes one, so we were really rolling the dice on this brand. The good news, she loves it, which is why I gave this a five for flavor. I haven't personally tried it, but she seems to enjoy it all the time.Additionally, its filled with good ingredients and plays nice with her stomach. I also like the smell, it doesn't stink like other dog food, which means she smells better, and probably that its made with better stuff.Blue Buffalo has been an overall positive experience for us and our new addition. Definitely give it a try!",

Anytime we buy it from the store, our dog Beesly loves it, no problems. My husband got our most recent bag from Amazon (despite me telling him about all these crazy reviews) he didn’t really believe it. Anyway, Beez started having extremely bad gas, was very timid, very lethargic, was barely eating and etc. we kept trying the food for a week, because my husband still didn’t understand how the same food would be so different from one place to another. I finally broke down today and bought a bag from the store. Pictured above are the differences between store bought (the darker one) and the Amazon purchase. It also smelled different. Our dog immediately devoured the store bought side, and the Amazon side is still untouched.We absolutely love Amazon. We’re quite frequent shoppers, and do a lot of subscribe and save. Never had any issues, until this.",

However, I thought at the time why not “subscribe and save” this would become a major error on my part. I received my package from Amazon and it was a box within a box. Firstly, nothing from Amazon comes undamaged these days. Nothing. The first box was opened. The second box was damaged. But the food looked unharmed. Wasn’t opened. Nothing. So I fed it to my three dogs, and my cat loves to steal their food if any is not eaten. By the very next day ALL FOUR. I repeat, ALL FOUR of my animals were sick. My dogs were pooping blood. Literally. My cat was vomiting and couldn’t even make it to the litter box. My dogs started to vomit and I had endless trips to the vet. Because their food had been messed with. I contacted customer service got a refund, ended my subscription.Thankfully my animals are all fine now but we will NEVER again purchase through the mail. So just beware and be cautious.",

I try to reason with him and say that he needs his healthy life source bits to continue to grow and be a healthy dog, but he doesn't always listen. I included two pics of Charlie Beagle. The one with his mouth open and jumping up is him being happy right after eating Blue Buffalo food. (Doesn't he look happy?) The other picture is of him without his Blue Buffalo.

Now that our dogs are getting on in age outside of our pup, we wanted a dog food that they would love and we would feel good about them eating it!

It caught us by surprise and we thought it was something he ate. we took him to the vet and he was severely dehydrated and had to stay over the weekend hooked up to an IV (90lb dog). Cost us $1400 and a almost dead dog. He recovered and came home, we continued to feed him this food and just last week (Nov 16) he had bloody vomit and stool again. We stopped all food for 24 hrs and got him GI antibiotics. We had to force water with a syringe to ensure he stayed hydrated. He is doing better now and we switched food back to taste of the wild. I will post an update to this if he continues to get sick after switching foods.",

Their coats are thick and shiny and their eyes, ears and skin are healthy and clear. We have tried other dogs foods, but we always come back to Blue Buffalo because the dogs clearly are healthier when eating it.",

            "review_text": "If it's in the budget doggie gets a decent brand of food.  There is at least one well regarded dog food review web site that also keeps track of recalls.  After a couple of disasters with pet food made in an unmentionable country or two I try to stick with well regarded brands that aren't made in those countries.  Many brands that used to be good have succumbed to the profit margin unfortunately.  Blue Buffalo consistently gets good reviews and as far as I know has never had a recall at least in recent history.  My dog apparently developed a sensitivity for chicken based dog food which is weird because he can eat fresh chicken with no ill effects meanwhile a chicken based dry food results in an explosively upset stomach (tired of cleaning that mess of puddles up off the floor kind of upset stomach).  My local stores have stopped stocking the big bags of this food which is the best value for the price so I order when I have to and amazon always comes through with the fastest arrival time to my door.  It's tough for me to wrangle a thirty pound bag of food out of the car anyway so shipping's probably the best for me anyway.  My dog seems to enjoy this and when the bag arrives at the front door it always gets wags and five minutes of insistent sniffing when it's taken out of the box.  They have several foods for sensitive metabolisms, apparently chicken sensitivity is common in dogs (if I had to guess I'd say all the junk we shoot chickens up with on the farms, hormones, etc.).  I've used this one and the salmon version he does great on both just the salmon is a bit higher priced.  Normally they say don't suddenly change your dog's diet but when the lamb can't be found he doesn't seem to have an issue going back and forth between this and the salmon.",

They would vomit bile once or twice a week when their tummies were empty, there was some kind of inflammation going on causing that to happen. The FISH AND RICE flavor have now kept them regular and their coats are gorgeous. There rarely vomit now and only seasonal allergies continue to be a problem with one of these guys. I've been feeding them this flavor and brand for a couple years now. I'll continue to use it, they don't get tired of the flavor, they still gobble it up.Only complaint would be the large price variations from one day to the next. Sometimes it's thirty something, sometimes it's fifty something. Seems like that kind of thing shouldn't be allowed. And when you sign up for the auto-ship I would think you would get the same price, but no, that fluctuates, too. Hard to budget when you don't know what the price will be from one month to the next.",

I read some reviews that suggested there had been a change in the food, which makes sense as I noticed the kibble shape had changedI decided to switch to a different brand and tried feeding a couple different flavors of Blue Buffalo to my buddy. Initially, he liked it much better than the Science Diet, but almost immediately he began to have really bad gas. It makes sense with a high protein diet, but it’s nearly constant. Additionally, we had a friend that fed his dog a high protein diet for the past several years and his dog now had cardiomyopathy, which had been related to high protein diets, even though it was marketed as “healthier” for dogs and more expensive.I finally decided to try switching again and picked Royal Canin, which came with good reviews from several sources. I’ve been splitting his food to transition him for the past several weeks, but placing each brand on opposite sides of the bowl. He immediately eats all of the Royal Canin and begrudgingly eats the Blue Buffalo. After reading several reviews about quality I decided I’m going to pitch the rest of this dog food. He hates it and I can’t handle any more of his gas.",

In addition to her not getting enough exercise she is acting very depressed and I can relate it to first the loss of mybeloved Australian Sheppard \"Dito\" 6 months ago and 2 weeks later the death of my wonderful husband in May from COVID.  We all need to exercise and eat our way back to health. I talked to my vet and did my own research and found the Blue Buffalo Healthy Weight Life protection formula. The cost was out of my reach in our local grocery store so I checked here on Amazon. On August 1st I bought a 30 lb bag of the chicken and brown rice formula for $35.53. Daisy did not complain at all as I started to mix it gradually into her food. Feeding her 2 cups twice daily she started to lose weight without begging for scraps or treats so I assume she was satisfied. A visit in September to the vet had a weigh in of 101 pounds. Amazing. She was able to jump up on the bed, looking to play tug with her giant rope and had a little spirit again. The vet wants her at 80 pounds so we intend to keep her on this food. Due to the mixing with daisy's old food for the first 14 day, that bag lasted 7 weeks. I purchased another 30 lb bag on September 20 for $34.26. I was checking prices on Prime Day for many of the deals and decided to buy another bag before I ran out and was shocked to find the price \"Starting at $54.88\" for the same 30 lb bag and not available as prime. That is a $20.00 increase!! Why?? I will find it very difficult to spend that much and I do not want to switch her food when she is doing so well now. I hope this increase is temporary...please.",

However, trying a fresh bag from the brick-n-mortar store, at the first dish, she's back to normal.  I didn't check the expiration date before I tossed the bag, so my bad.  But beware...",

We are not 100% sure if the quality is better when buying from local stores but evidently the quality of the product is not consistent from bag to bag here at Amazon. We are too scared to go back to this brand as for right now, not sure if the risk is worth.I'm a big time Amazon consumer and I spend thousands of dollars here and give true good reviews on many many other things here but this time I'm taking the time to write a bad review for a good reason.",

I always end up coming back to BB.Well this particular purchase, I disappointedly received the package with a teeny-tiny hole in the bag therefore causing it to be covered in ants while it sat outside my front door (see my attached picture). Thankfully, customer service refunded me 100%. I had to pick up a bag from the local pet store because I timed the dog food to arrive on the day we just ran out completely. This was a new flavor my dog has yet to try. I believe if he had gotten to try it, he would have loved it. But since the packaging was compromised. I had to toss the whole thing, unfortunately. Once we run out of the last minute purchase from the pet store, we will consider trying this again.",

Once she was on 100% Blue Buffalo she was no longer itchy, her fur started looking even better and she stopped smelling so bad.  She has more energy and overall is a happier dog.  Now all three dogs get Blue Buffalo and all three seem happier and healthier.  The stuff I was buying before was almost as expensive as Blue Buffalo but it apparently wasn't near the quality.",

I never have really had issues with stuff being bad from amazon so I took my chance and checked the dog food when it came in.  It looked fine. .... NOW here we are 2 months later and ALL of that dog food is green, molded and falls apart like powder when you touch it.  I keep it all in a large plastic tote with a lid and never had any issues with this happening in the 8years we’ve had our American Bulldog.  He started acting different right about the time the dog food changed colors and we’ve had to throw everything away! Even the other food that wasn’t this garbage from I don’t know where that I bought thinking it was blue buffalo.  So if you’re reading reviews like I once did and you’re not sure if the bad reviews are “real” or of it’ll happen to you.... just go elsewhere.  I promise it’s not worth it to see your poor dog loopy and sickly. It may seem fine at first but it shouldn’t go bad like that.  Somethings not right.",

I went from Hills Science to this and I immediately regretted trying to save $10/$20. Filter reviews and photos if needed. I absolutely switched foods again and they’re doing so much better.

Since there are no other animal by products in this (which is apparently pretty hard to find) this recipe fit the bill. All of my dogs now eat the lamb formula and love it.  All of their coats are shiny and soft, and even their breath smells better. Dog food itself, I'd give a 5 star all day.Only downside- Packaging was great. Box was in perfect condition, however I could hear the food moving around in the box. Opened the box and there was a giant slice in the bag. Kind of just want to return this and get a bag of food for my dogs that hasn't been exposed to who knows what....",

After getting her favorite food again she has been scared of her food bowl, even if I set with the bowl on the floor and entice her over as soon as I motion for the food bowl she tucks tail and turns away.  My 8 year old Karin Terrier, who is not picky at all, will barely touch it.  I tried mixing with the tried and true favorite but to no avail.  I've used the same flavor in the Costco brand and they were fine with that but this product really turned them off.  :(",

We decided to try this because our preferred brand did not carry a fish based protein food and we were determining if our newly adopted pup had food allergies (also because of all the hype Blue puts out there about their food quality). It also smells horrible; definitely a very fishy smell to it. Thankfully, Blue and amazon refunded my purchased. If looking for a fish based food, I recommend purina pro plan sensitive skin and stomach salmon and rice. It’s done miracles for my dogs!",

I fed her the regular Blue Buffalo before because its pretty much the only kind she'll eat, without me having to mix in chicken breast or Cottage Cheese. She's a picky eater lolI don't know what's in this Healthy Weight stuff, or what's different between this one and the regular Blue Buffalo, but for over a year my dog had 2 pretty large cysts on her neck and her flank, that kept getting bigger and would sometimes burst open and leak, only to fill back up. (Both were benign) The vet told me I could have them removed and gave me an estimate....Within a month of feeding her the Healthy Weight, THEY DISAPPEARED. They're gone.Could the Makers of Blue Buffalo please tell me what's in it or isn't in it, that made the cysts go away?? Would be interesting to know, because cysts are very common in boxers.It could help other dog owners too, by avoiding certain ingredients or brands.I just saved a bunch of money (in surgery cost) by switching to Healthy Weight!Thanks",

She is not overweight so I bought Blue weight control! Few months back I bought a bag and it was full of weevils & bugs. Target gave me a refund and I threw it out, I did contact the company and Blue blame Target. Okay THEN last bag made my baby very ill, horrible bloody stools so bad I had to take her to the pet ER. Next day my regular Vet told me to STOP feeding Blue Buffalo, since the company was sold a few yrs back and it's CRAP NOW! Okay he didn't say crap that's My words> his where a wee bit nicer.  Yet he tired of pets coming in sick from eating Blue Buffalo! So here the kicker thought since I paid so much for the bag my 13 year old (stomach of steel) could eat it. Within 24 hours he has diarrhea. Now I'm counting back to my baby girl having gut issues and it's not long after the company was sold! Be careful people! Warning not only from a pet parent BUT my Vet!",

He had terrible allergies until I got him back on his regular food. My other dog got super sick twice. This didn't happen at the very beginning, it happened towards the end so I know its not just from the food transition. After doing more research, this brand is known to make dogs severely ill. I have seen multiple stories where the outcome is death! All I can say is DO YOUR RESEARCH before buying and feeding this to your furbabies.",

            "review_text": "This is my first time to ever write a review on Amazon.  But buyers of this product should beware that you are risking the life and health of your dog.  I am giving this product a 1 because there is not a 0.  We purchased this product because there were so many good reviews on Amazon.  We have 3 golden retrievers.  The oldest, about 8 years old has suffered from Pancreatitis.  She has recovered and we selected this food because of its low fat content and reviews about helping dogs with digestive issues.  We have been making home made food for our dogs but with 3 it was just too much work.  We chose the healthy weight product for this dog and the Lamb and Rice for adult dogs for the other two.After one week on this food, our Golden Retriever started to wobble and seemed week in the back legs.  After 10 days she could not even walk!!!!!  I started doing research and there are LOTS of comments and reviews on Amazon and other sources about issues with this food, many of which are related with not begging able to walk.  I can not understand why a product with such pervasive issues can still be on the market.  Blue Buffalo should be removed form the shelves, because it is DANGEROUS for your animals.We have cancelled the subscription we set up, and will be working very hard to regain the health of our family pet.  I hope that this review helps protect other customers from this dangerous company and product.PLEASE DO NOT BUY ANY BLUE BUFFALO PRODUCTS.",

            "review_text": "So, my dog was fine eating this. He started on the puppy formula and progressed to adult formula. His poop was a little yellow and sometimes loose, so I switched him the BB's Limited Ingredient recipe that had lamb to see if that had an effect. I think chicken just isn't something his body handles in larger quantities (treats with chicken do not seem to impact him much), but that isn't the food's fault. Transferring to lamb basically instantly work for him. So, before you blame the brand, give either another protein a shot or try their grain-free or limited options. I try to keep my dog and a fairly monitored diet and preferred limited ingredient items. I did order this using Prime and as a one-time purchase. I do not advise buying food related items from a third party seller, but I have never had an issue with Prime items. The package arrive undamaged and no bug issues. Just make sure you check the bag and expiration before use because if food is exposed or outdated then of course you will see negative side effects. We keep this food in a storage tub in a room not exposed to sunlight, if that matters.",

            "review_text": "My dog eats once a day around 4 pm just one cup of dry and some chicken.  She's not even done with her first Blue Buffalo bag and she has blown up like a balloon.  I am taking her off this carbohydrate garbage right away.  Found a very low carb dogfood online which is even more expensive then this stuff.  But I'm willing to give it a try, she's getting older and it is hard to control her weight. For the price and the way everyone praises Blue Buffalo I expected better, this stuff is trash.  She exercises every day and is still very active.  But this food is just loaded with carbs and If I keep her on it I know she will have serious health issues.  If I cut her down to a half a cup she's going to keep crying because she's hungry, never buying this brand again.Update: After taking her off the Blue Buffalo and putting her on a new brand \"Ketonatural\" which I think is a fairly new business.  Regardless, she lost a large amount of weight in just a week.  She developed a layer of fat from the Blue Buffalo that you could feel with your hands and was obviously unhealthy.  The fat is almost completely gone and she is loving the stuff.  Only downside is the price, it was $120 for a 24lb bag and $100 for a 16lb.  Thank God I can afford it but I understand if it's not an option for some.  If this food is causing weight problems, it's all the carbs in these dog foods.  Greedy executives do not care about your dogs health, it's up to you to do the research.",

Bag. I feel I must share this so other dog lovers can make an informed decision. In short, I say stay away from this dog food. My Goldendoodle, Prince, had been eating this dog food (in a beige, bleu, red bag) for two weeks. I started feeding my dog this food April 21st, then two weeks later he had severe diarrhea, with blood and mucus in his stool.  Then this week he develop a rash/yeast infection and started shaking from side to side. He's breathing pattern has change, the rashes on his chest and shoulder are so bad he can hardly lay down or sleep. He sits most of the time during the day and at night. It breaks my heart seeing him this way. He was also lethargic and slow moving all day long (this is an extremely active and fast moving dog, and slow movements is out of character for him). When you touched him, he would yelp in pain. We are at the vet right now couldn't wait to write this review. Shame on you Blue Buffalo with this hype about \"holistic life protection\" bull caca. I think it would be fair to compensate me my money back. Vet bills are no joke. Hoping he pulls through this nightmare.",

Having senior dogs, we switched to this brand when they were 4 and 6 and now they are 11 and 13 and I truly believe the higher qualify food kept them healthy to be with us longer.

So far there have been 3 items ive bought off Amazon from Amazon that  are inferior to the real items. Like all other reviewers  after  a week eating this food my dog has begun scratching like crazy ,losing hair and breathing heavily. She will no longer eat this food. Went to the local store where pets go and bought the same items and they are  clearly much better quality visually as well as smell and of course my dog has not hesitated to eat as she did with the amazon  bag.  Its only the 1st day hopefully i will see fast improvement of the issues caused by this inferior item. This needs to be investigated. Is it a quality control issue, just cutting cost in the name of profit or something else. This is obviously much more then just a bad batch. Its been dog food, dog toothpaste,  and dog vitamins so far with the same issues.  I will no longer take a chance at my dogs expense just for the convenience of home delivery. Anyone reading this  please  dont allow your dog or other pets to be victim of whatever is at the cause of these issues.  Stay safe",

I didn’t understand what was going on because it’s the same product as always. The ONLY change is where I ordered it from. So I decided to get on amazon to look at reviews and turns out I’m not the only one. There is something different about this product on Amazon. DO NOT BUY from here. Get it off chewy instead!!!!

Some dog food \"kibble\" are more expensive than others but over time your dogs internal organs will break down from lack of protein. They will develop itchy patches and ear problems. The vet will say it's allergies. It's not believe me! He sells kibble so it's a financial gravy train for him. Antihistamines and shots that have nothing to do with what is destroying your dog is typical unless you go to a holistic vet. Dogs are now considered old at 11 and 12 sadly when 18 should be the norm and once was before \"kibble\" reared it ugly head! It's not considered edible for humans so why would you even consider feeding it to your dog? Most ingredients come from euthanized pets rotting parts of caucuses they can't sell, it's mixed with chemically produced vitamins from China and cooked at high temperatures FOUR TIMES. Also no root vegetables, carbs, kibble, grain or most fruit. Inappropriate food for a dog! It turns to sugar in their body causing yeast overgrowth. Amazon sells lots of liquid vitamins, minerals and calcium. Buy chicken, chop meat cook or not, add the vitamins and a few greens! You won't have vet bills and your dog will live to at least 18.",

            "review_text": "I am not one to take the time to write a review. I generally find no quality in reading other people’s subjective take on this food. Really can a human be subjective when it comes to dog food? Isn’t the dog the only one that can be subjective? Okay so with that out of the way, I appreciate everyone’s negative feedback regarding this food. I understand that it does take time to write these things and put in the mental currency needed to write a good one. So now to my “objective” review of how my dogs seem to like this food. They all LOVE it. I have all three of my dogs on it - my oldest is an 11 yr old boxer with renal failure (she’s on prescription wet food, the Rx dry food is insanely expensive), another is a 6 yr old Boston Terrier that got to be a little chubby so I was looking for her to lose some weight (and with this food she has!) and the last little guy is my newest pup: he’s a 1.5 yr old Brussels Griffon that LOVES to eat everything! (And get loves to eat this food! I’ve had to buy him one of these weird bowls that look like a puzzle just to get him to slow down eating it.)I’ve never noticed any change in production quality, every bag that I’ve received has had a seemingly equal part of their “bits” or whatever they call them. I do mix this with a little bit of wet food for the two smaller pups and quite a bit for my medium-sized aging boxer.So to conclude, don’t listen to the reviews; listen to your dogs! My boxer has always had a sensitive stomach - in fact she was on sensitive stomach Rx dry food before the whole Renal failure hit - and she has not had a single reaction to this food.They have all been chowing down on this food for almost 8 months now I want to say. So yeah it’s Blue Buffalo, it’s quality, don’t let your own “dog-like precocious” feelings vicariously attach to the dog. Because as humans, it’s easy to see “what we want to see” in our dogs!",

If I had known that before I would have found something else. My Husky is currently on the floor, not moving, breathing heavily, in clear gastrointestinal distress. I started switching him over to Blue Buffalo a couple days ago, mixing half a portion in with his original food. He started getting a bit more sluggish, but we thought nothing of it, thinking he just needed some time to adjust to the switch. He also wouldn't eat the food for long periods of time. He is a picky eater, so again, we thought nothing of it. Now, today, we can barely get him to move.There is clearly something wrong with this food. I guess maybe it only affects a smaller percentage of dogs (visibly) since the overall reviews are really good, or maybe this is only a recent development. Either way, I would not risk feeding your dog this food. Find a different brand.",

He just turned 18months so it was time to switch him from puppy to adult food. I made sure to slowly transition the food, slowly mixing more and more in with his old food for over 2 weeks. He has now been eating the new food for over a month. Well whatever is in this food or if its 2 bad bags it is terrible. I let him go through a bag and a half before I stopped \"giving it a chance\".He has been pooping twice as often as he was before and his poop smells HORRID, it literally makes me gag and almost throw up when before I could not even smell it. Not to mention he has had horrible gas that has been stinking up the house. I hear him/smell him fart at least 10 times a day now, before this we maybe heard him fart a couple times a week.I really believe in Blue Buffalo products so I kept wanting to give this a chance, but I cannot keep risking whatever this is doing to my dogs insides because even if it is not harming him in anyway it cannot be good how it is effecting his bowels.",

For the past two years we have been feeding our dog, Cooper, Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula Natural Adult Dry Dog Food as we were told this was a high-quality food and good for Cooper as he has a mild case of IBS.  Over the past week and a half my dog, Cooper, has been experiencing loose poop and diarrhea - we took him to the vet twice to see what was going on.  The vet took stool samples and did not find any worms or other issues.  We were instructed to do chicken & rice for a few days to see if that helped.  It did - today was the first day to add some of his Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula Natural Adult Dry Dog Food back into his diet and as I was scooping out the kibble, I found TWO DEAD DISINTEGRATING RAT/MOUSE bodies in the kibble.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  We will never buy Blue Buffalo products again as this bag of kibble caused two vet visits and lots of vet bills where the source was the kibble.  My husband and I are absolutely disgusted and are very upset that this 'trusted' brand failed us.",

He doesn’t hate them, but he usually avoids them to the extent he can. And my dog is not a picky eater. This is a minor complaint, because he still eats and eats well. And he is very healthy, and my vet agrees.I haven’t tasted the offending kibble myself yet, so I can’t say if they have a particular flavor. But in general I think things in dog food that are engineered to look like other (more appealing) things for the benefit of the owner, not the dog, are unnecessary.Overall, the food really does smell like chicken, which is about as good as it gets, as long as the flavor is “chicken”. I haven’t tried other flavors, but if they all smell like chicken I’ll update my review.",

My vet said chicken fat is the same as chicken.  It's no wonder there are a lot of dogs running around with stomach aches and owners don't have a clue because no one, but me, actually reads ingredients before giving to their dogs.  I tried and tried on line to find list of ingredients to no avail.  I enlarged it and images refused to show \"side\" panel with ingredients on it.  I can feed it to one dog, it will last me a long time, but I will never order it again nor any other \"blue Buffalo\" product because of the usage of Chicken Fat.",

I decided I wanted to save some money buying it through Amazon rather than my local pet store. So I bought two 30lb bags. I read a lot of reviews and was surprised and skeptical, when I received my dog food, I can tell by the color of the kibble itself, it was not fresh. My dogs were also not interested in eating the kibble, which indicates that they know something is off. My older kibble was more fresh. Amazon quickly refunded me after I let them know, I went to a local pet store, bought the same 30lb bag, and it was much more better. The expiration date from the one I received from amazon was Jun 10 2021, the one I received from a local pet store was Jun 13 2021. I am not sure if it was just a bad batch, however a lot of reviews were claiming the same thing. So please just be careful, and inspect each bag you receive.",

I still wasn’t convinced it was the food at this point. My older dog started chewing on hisself like something terrible and then he chewed his toenails to the point of them falling off and bleeding. I then saw all of the comments on here and the reviews so I went and purchased a new bag from the store and within days I saw a difference and my dogs are normal again.",

            "review_text": "Used to buy this dog food at a local store but unbeknownst to me they were offering me an introductory price and didn't tell me. Suddenly after a year they suddenly jump the price on me almost $20! Or it might be because of the raise in minimum wage and stores are no longer absorbing those costs ... either way can't afford the retailer prices anymore so I found the Blue Buffalo here on Amazon. I find it funny that they offer you the review and ask you about taste oh, I didn't taste it! The dogs eat it but then again the dogs will eat any knock off garbage dog food that I buy as well. Side note Blue Buffalo is suffering a scandal right now that they were adding some kind of meal to their ingredients rather than their claim of real meat being the first ingredient. I don't believe even the high-end dog foods are adding real meat, even though they claim it's chicken beef pork fish I believe we're really getting the by products like lungs intestines cartilage etc. The real meat is going for human consumption at $7 a pound. How can they put real meat in this dog food along with the other binders and fillers process it all and then sell it for $2 a pound? It's like that fast food restaurant that claims 100% beef patties. Don't let that fool you 100% beef can still contain 30% fat, because fat is still considered beef,  part of the cow. They didn't claim 100% lean! There is always this sleight of hand advertising that will trick the mind into thinking you've got something you didn't get. I always get a good chuckle out of other reviews that claim their dog was poisoned by certain foods, or their dog will only eat certain foods , these are the same dogs who probably eat their own excrement and being a dog I guarantee they're licking themselves all over everywhere and probably the owners face as well, yet the owner wants to claim one dog food is better  than another?  Unless he  tasted it, ate it for some time and actually built muscle  and energy  and a shiny coat of hair on himself  I would have to contend  the owner  has no clue whether this dog foods is beneficial or not. So this is still just another high-priced dog food but I buy it so take that with a grain of salt.",

We had him on a grain-free blue buffalo before, so we were going to switch anyway (as grain-free has been connected to heart disease). He has lost about 2 lbs over the course of consuming a little over one bag. The real change is in his behavior. He is able to run and jump with more agility. He is so much more playful. He doesn’t get excited to eat like he used to, but I don’t get excited about diet food either.",

When I worked in a dog kennel, my boss told me Blue Buffalo was the best brand, but I figured, since it's a little pricier, could it really make such a difference? ABSOLUTELY. My dogs have much more energy, they are actually LOSING WEIGHT and have more visible muscle definition even though I have only reduced their portions by 1/4 of a cup and have not increased their activity. Their coats are so much softer and healthier. If you haven't tried this, please do. It is quality food for your fur babies. :)",

We thought it was possibly because she was eating so much of her little humans' food off their plates, so maybe she just wasn't hungry.  Since it was time to move her from puppy to adult food, I did some research to find out what food was the best for her AND within our budget.  After finding an insanely good deal on Amazon, we went with Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula and my mind was blown.  Jolene is scarfing down her food within minutes at meal time, instead of leaving most of it in the bowl.  This morning, she whined for more (she had already gone 1/2 cup over her per meal time serving, so she didn't get it since we need her to maintain her health) and actually tried to pull and push my husband over to the closet where her food is kept.  I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.  Needless to say, we're thrilled with our purchase and won't be cancelling our \"subscribe & save\" on this product.",

We switched him to Blue Buffalo from Diamond Naturals grain-free after reading about grain-free foods and their possible long term negative effects on a dog's heart.After switching, I noticed he started to put on some weight (in a good way) as he was always shall we say, athletic in his build. In addition, he had some skin irritations which we battled since he was a pup, and they mysteriously vanished about two months after we switched to Blue Buffalo. Could be a coincidence, but I'm inclined to think not.It's a bit more expensive than what we used to feed him, but he seems healthier and to me, that's worth every penny.",

He regularly eats his food and doesn’t seem to show disinterest.Cons: My only complaint is that it seems to make him gassy. My vet said that can happen with age,breed, or how fast he eats. I started using a slow feeder and that has curbed the issue some.Overall: I think this is a great buy for a dog that needs to maintain or lose some weight. Buying on amazon is also cheaper than the stores, I save around $10-15 a bag and we go through this bag in about a month in a half.",

My big dogs eat every bit of it I have had them on many different kinds of food and they love BLUE!  I highly recommend this food my dogs have done great on it and they changed right over with not having runny stools. Again I had to recommend this food but the one with grain free not the one that’s grain free they have found that grain free is affecting some dogs brains and killing them.  If you prefer to have a grain free food blue also makes that that I feed my dogs the one with the brain and I highly recommend it",

I opened it on Thanksgiving and my dog wouldn’t touch it. Would just walk up, sniff and walk away. He usually voraciously attacks it. I thought maybe there were too many distractions with people food (that he didn’t get) so I didn’t think much of it. Didn’t touch it the whole day breakfast or dinner. The next day his stomach was audibly rumbling, but he still wouldn’t eat it. I fed him some wet food and he attacked it. I tried again with the Blue Buffalo , and this time he did eat a little. But later vomited. I was very concerned he had a blockage or other ailment. I read some reviews here that showed other people had some issues with spoiled Blue Buffalo from Amazon. For a test, I went out to Petsmart and bought a bag of the exact same brand and recipe. Boom!! He’s been eating it like always. No issues. So clearly the bag I bought from Amazon was spoiled. I’m very disappointed and hope there is no permanent damage to my dogs system. Please beware of this. I know Amazon has cheaper prices, and all my previous experiences were good - but I will never buy any food product from them again. Absolutely cannot trust it.",

Sometimes, when I first open the bag, it even smells almost appetizing to me ;)  I like the small kibble size and the fact that I don't have to feed as large a volume - between 2 and 2-1/2 cups per day for my 50 lb dog. This food is also fairly easy to hydrate and serve wet - I find that pouring very hot water in just about to cover and letting it sit for about a half hour (stirring once about halfway through) before serving works best.My only beef with this stuff is the box size that Amazon uses.  The proper box size for this is probably the 1BG or B11 or P1, and they frequently deliver it in a 3A1 which could probably fit two bags of this.",

I bought her this brand of Blue Buffalo to try. It had a four star review so it didn't occur to me to read the reviews. A week after transitioning her to Blue Buffalo she began having bloody diarrhea and vomiting. After two days off work and little sleep, because I had to take her outside so frequently. After a very expensive trip to the vet, where she needed an IV for lost fluids and her blood work indicated inflammation in her pancreas and elevated glucose levels, I did some research on Blue Buffalo and I see here that there are many negative reviews claiming similar issues. Please don't risk your dog's health.",

I turned on the subscription for this because I don't like trying to break my back picking up dog food because I don't know if you noticed but at the grocery store they always put the largest bag of dog food closest to the floor. Anyways I definitely love this dog food for my dog he has gluten tendencies so he's kind of gluten-free and this just is a healthier option and we haven't had any problems with this dog food and my puppy stays regular and is just a very happy dog and he loves the taste of it!",

After going the vet and getting completely cleared i decided to check the reviews for this product again and literally everyone is having the same issue as me. My dog has not been eating the food and what little he does consume from absolute hunger he immediately throws back up and has diarrhea with every bowel movement. I bought a little bag of the same product from petsmart and he ate with no issue so clearly it is Amazon's product in itself. Also, the last bag they sent me had roaches all in it. I need a refund for the last 3 months of waisted money on food my dog didn't even eat and I had to throw away. Fix this amazon!!!!!",

            "review_text": "Our dogs have always eaten BB and have routinely gone through periods of vomiting and diarrhea during which we frequently questioned the food.  But, hey, it's Blue Buffalo right?A month or so ago our one dog started having minor seizures along with some vomiting and diarrhea.  Took him to the vet and some of his blood work was off (liver/pancreas) so they started running tests.  Several weeks (and much expense) later, they had no explanation for his condition.  He then refused to touch the Blue Buffalo food but would take other food presented to him.  On a side note, our other dog was also having some vomiting and diarrhea issues during this period.The more research I did some type of toxin was looking like a possible cause.  I then Googled Blue Buffalo and \"sick dogs\" and was amazed at the results.  Consumer Affairs website is loaded with complaints and they have a 2 star rating with them.  Tons of sick dogs reports.... mostly vomiting, diarrhea, etc.  I've even read of quite a few deaths.We've placed both of them on a different high quality dry food and our sick dog is already looking and acting better.  Hopefully his blood work will show improvement but it's too early to tell.  I'll try to post an update when we have additional information but we're tossing a brand new 38 lb bag (that one from a wholesale club).Please read the numerous reviews just on Amazon of dogs becoming ill from this food.  It's obviously not all bags but something is very wrong and this company has had quality control issues previously from contaminated food.Update:  After being on the new food for about 5 days, both dogs are apparently back to full health (including liver function).",

I have read other reviews that have claimed this is not the actual brand of dog food and am starting to agree. This last bag I bought my dog started to lick himself uncontrollably. So much so he gave himself bald spots on his leg, tail and paw. We gave him baths, treated him for ticks and mosquitos. We finally went to the vet and were told to try changing his dog food. This fixed the problem within a few days. I am well outside my return window but have contacted customer service to get my money back. This is 100% unacceptable and I will no longer be buying pet food off of amazon. I am considering canceling my prime because of this. Do not buy any animal food off of amazon unless you hate your pet.",

I really want to include salmon in his diet to help his skin.  We do not want grain free or break the bank on a super expensive dog food.  Not sure we will stick with this food.  We alternate among several different bags but overall we are happy with Blue Buffalo.  It would be nice if Amazon listed or posted the ingredients with percentages from the side of the bag.  Some of the Blue bags have the ingredients listed on the side of the bag and those pictures are not included for viewing.",

I find these little thingys on the floor around her bowl every night. Obviously, whatever they are don't appeal to my dog. I'm certain my dog is not alone.

            "review_text": "I have an 11-year-old pug dog named Babu, and we have always fed him Blue Buffalo dog food since he was a baby.  We started him on half-a-cup of Blue Buffalo's \n\nChicken & Brown Rice Recipe\n\n   twice a day.  Pug dogs tend to get fat with their diet and lack of exercise.  However, Babu has always been in a good weight range while eating Blue Buffalo food (at around 20-lb).  As Babu got older, our veterinarian wanted us to transition Babu to a senior food which has exactly the same ingredients, but less calories.  We easily transitioned him to the Senior \n\nChicken & Brown Rice Recipe\n\n   from Blue Buffalo.Babu has always loved his kibble, but it was starting to get hard on his teeth.  He stopped eating at one point because of this, and we had to hand feed him his kibble one-by-one (which took FOREVER)!  After getting his teeth cleaned and speaking to the vet, they recommended mixing his food with soft/wet canned food.  Luckily, Blue Buffalo also makes canned food, and I purchased the \n\nChicken Dinner with Garden Vegetables\n\n  .  We start feeding Babu quarter-of-a-cup of kibble and mixed it in with the soft/wet canned food.  The canned food made the kibble a bit softer and more manageable on Babu's teeth.  Luckily, this worked perfectly, and we never had to feed Babu by hand again!  He chows down his food like a champion.  I want to give a big \"thank you\" to Blue Buffalo for giving my dog a great life and keeping him healthy for all these years!",

I want my 3 dogs to be happy and healthy like we all do and my Labradoodle is 8 and has always been healthy, thank goodness, my mini Aussie is 10 and she is reasonably healthy for 10 as well and I also have a Shih Tzu who is 4 and he very rarely throws up which is common because of there flat noses and I put all this down to this food. They never leave any, they sleep well, they listen, most of the time.....lol  and I put all this down to good nutrition. I want them to live forever like we all do so I believe they need to eat the right foods, no scraps, cause a lot are toxic to them, so I would definitely recommend this food......Thank you 'Blue' you make my doggies happy!!",

I had read some of the reviews of dogs getting sick but wrote them off as isolated incidents or a sudden change in food. 3 weeks into the first bag from Amazon, my dog got sick with diarrhea throughout the day and night. I thought she must have eaten something outside and gave it a couple of days. When there was no improvement I remembered the reviews. I discontinued the food and cooked her extra of my food. Within 24 hours all was normal again. I opened the second bag of food from Amazon the next day. Within hours she was sick again. I went out and bought a different brand and fed her that for a week. No problems. Then bought the Blue Buffalo again from the local distributor and still everything was fine. There was clearly something wrong with the Blue Buffalo food sold on Amazon. Either it was counterfeit or mishandled. I tried to save a few dollars but threw away over $50 worth of food! But I consider myself lucky after reading recent reviews that dogs have died from eating this food. If you love your dog, DO NOT FEED HER THIS FOOD!!",

I mean, I was literally walking around looking for poop even though all three are house broken and haven't had an accident in a very long time. Then, about 48 hours later, my little Chipin developed loose stool. The gas smell is so bad, i have had to kennel my dogs at night and they normally sleep with me. Had to dump the Blue Buffalo today and went to the store and bought the Purina One. And this is not an isolated incident. You can search Blue Buffalo causing bad gas and there are pages on top of pages of people with this same problem.",

She had no bacteria, but had struvite crystals, usually associated with UTIs. When I asked my vet how this could be, she asked what food I have been feeding her, and when I told her Blue Buffalo, she immediately said that it causes these crystals. I am grateful that we caught it. I had no idea and so hopefully this review will lead others to STAY AWAY FROM BB!!! Thankfully Amazon refunded the money for the food, but this should never be sold without a major warning on it! Would like to have Amazon or BB refund me for the vet bill also!",

My mom, who lives across the country, also feeds her dog this food and her dog also got sick after eating from a brand new bag purchased around the same time. I checked with some of the other owners in a dog owners' Facebook group I'm part of and several of them have had the exact same experience. Apparently one talked to a manager at her local pet store who said they would no longer be carrying this food as the quality has gone down recently. I will definitely be switching to something else.",

Unfortunately the change happened at the same time as a small procedure and my dog had a lot of problems, most related to inflamed bowel syndrome. The vet and I assumed it was a reaction to the procedure and we tried to manage it with steroids and probiotics.For 6 months my dog was miserable having to urinate all the time from the steroids and having uncontrollable bowel movements frequently. My vet and I were doing everything we could think of because my dog was running out of gas and didn't have much left in him.In a loss for anything else to try I switched him back to Science Diet Lamb and Rice and within a week he was cleared up and we discontinued all the other treatments. He no longer has swollen bowl syndrome but does have a severe allergy to whatever was in the Blue Buffalo food.Be warned, changing foods can cause problems, even if you think you are upgrading to something better. I could have saved myself hundreds of dollars in \"premium\" dog food and thousands of dollars in \"treatments\" required by the dog food. I only wish I never did it and never was responsible for my dog going through six months of misery.",

My dog got sick. She would barley eat and had digestive issues. Never dawned on me it was the food. I ended up getting a bag of the same food from Target because we ran out before my next subscription was due to arrive and all her issues passed and she was back to normal. I got my next subscription bag from Amazon a week and half ago and been feeding my dog from it the last 2 weeks. Again she stopped eating, started excessively panting all day, and was just not her normal, energetic self. My husband picked up a bag from Target earlier today and she ate the minute that food hit her bowl. We can already tell a difference in her energy. Something is not right with the food coming from Amazon. I’m not sure if this is coming from a different manufacturer or what. Please just be cautious when feeding this to your dog.",

Second bag was a different story. Dog became extremely thirsty; she would throw up the contents of her stomach once a day; for nearly two weeks straight. Spoke with the vet and he suggested it was a gag reflex issue, from lapping air with water. I purchased a bowl with floater device to help reduce the amount of air ingested. Sadly it didn’t work. After two weeks I pulled her off the food and switched her to chicken and rice - assuming her stomach was inflamed and she wasn’t consuming the nutrients needed. She stopped throwing up and returned to her normal self. I’m disappointed in the food; obviously there is an inconsistency either in ingredients used, or an issue with distribution (old food, poor storage?). Aggravated that I spent money on the 30lb bag of food, on a water bowl I didn’t need - and now I’m left scrambling to find a replacement food.",

It's Christmas, everything is closed, but back to the store tomorrow for something better. So many reviewers have talked about their dogs getting sick on it, but I thought, \"Never Fred! He loves to eat!!\" Fred is NOT a fan of this dog food, and neither am I. I don't even think I will take to dog shelter. This food makes some dogs sick!!!",

Our dogs never had any issues, normally we do purchase our dog food at petco or pet smart. We bought a bag of dog food from amazon a few months ago and there was no problem. Then we just purchased a bag a few days ago and started feeding our dogs with it. They have had the diarrhea and vomiting since we started feeding them the dog food. We stopped feeding them that food and purchased a bag from petsmart and their diarrhea and vomiting stopped. I’m not positive if we got a defected bag or an old bag that caused this but I’m very upset because my dogs have never had this severe of an issue with eating their food. Needless to say I would beware when receiving your item and make sure their is no issue check the bag unlike I did.",

Just like my previous shih tzu’s, she wouldn’t eat dry food w/out being mixed w/the soft food. My 3 year old rescue mutt saw what she was getting & refused dry food w/out a soft mixer.I decided to try this BB food. Both dogs ate heartily, with no soft food mixed in. My 3 y/o licked his bowl until he drug it around the house!!!This must be a very tasty formula & I wish I tried it sooner. The dogs are so, so happy with it!!!!",

My mom read an article about certain brands of food causing skin irritation in dogs.  I was using one of the brands listed.  I decided to switch.  This food had really great reviews so I decided to try it.  I can honestly say our dog’s fur has not looked better.  It is very shiny and very soft.  She no longer has any skin issues.  Now that I have seen the difference I will not go back to cheap dog food.",

The Blue Buffalo really did the trick, she never threw up and this is the first one which doesn't cause her diarrhea. Her hair looks shiny and she likes the taste. She is a high energy dog and I had trouble with previous foods because she actually needed way more than it was suggested on the feeding instruction but with BB she needs a less than suggested on the feeding instructions (I always adjust it to her activities, current weight, weather etc).I found the reviews here really concerning. Many people just switch food from one day to the other and then are surprised that the dog gets sick. A few people said the dog had digestive issues for weeks before visiting the vet... I understand that you are disappointed and worried but I don't think the food is the issue in many of these cases. Also not every food is good for every dog,  but it doesn't mean there is anything wrong with Blue Buffalo, just like there is nothing wrong with the X other premium category food that did not work for us.",

            "review_text": "This is the only food that agrees with my two Alaskan Malamutes and getting it deliver to my door step is wonderful since I usually buy 2 - 30 lbs. bags a month. Comes right on time or even before a few days before the scheduled delivery day and it's a few bucks cheaper than the pets stores around here. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because on the last few deliveries at least one of the bags is ripped and some of the food was spilled inside the box. Therefore, not only it creates a little extra work for us to clean up the mess, but also we have now an open bag of dog food we might not be ready to use quite yet. Other than that I highly recommend this product.",

I went to  the vet and he told me  it was dietary problems.  went to my local dog store and picked up the same food and now he seems to be fine.

I can’t stress enough how horrible this is for pets. Just cause people push this everywhere doesn’t make it good.",

Then my son referred me to Blue Buffalo because he had switched to it.  I was hesitant at first, fearing that my dogs would not adapt and I’d be stuck with a 30 lb bag of dog food to give to a shelter (which is a good idea anyway).  Well, my dogs love it and changing to Blue Buffalo had no effect on their digestive system (like runny poops).  In the process of using up the last of my old dog food, I put both foods in my one dog’s dish, and she actually ate around the old food and went to Blue Buffalo first!",

Ever since I switched her over to Blue Buffalo, she has broken out in hot spots. They get so bad that they break open and getting a dogs ear to stop bleeding and not bleed again is almost impossible without having to go spend an arm and a leg at the vet.We have since switched over to Hill’s Science Diet (lamb and brown rice) and she has had no issues with her ears. She loves eating this. There are no more nights sitting with her trying to encourage her to eat a food that clearly she knew made her feel yucky.Do not buy this type of food if your dog has food sensitivities or allergies. It’s an absolute nightmare!!!",

Most recently my daughter's boxer mix began to experience extreme diarrhoea and the skin problems reappeared on our airedale.As soon as my daughter switched foods her dog's problem cleared up and we have decided to switch brands.Just because my dog can't speak doesn't mean I can't understand when something is wrong.",

He indicated that there was a pretty strong indictment of Blue Buffalo at the last national vet society meeting he attended, mentioning that this gimicky, expensive food is associated with some rather strange issues in dogs, potentially associated with the \"over\" supply of nutrients for these animals.  People are fixated on getting significant nutritional supplementation for themselves, translating this into needs for their pets as well.  The reality is that canines evolved on rather poor diets and heavily supplemented foods are not really good for our animals.  One of the issues he and other vets is seeing is bone pain and types of arthritis.  He did not go into the suspected pathology but indicated that there is some pretty good evidence that this is being associated with the high nutrition diets that are all the fad right now.  Save your money and go with basic dog foods like those from Purina.  Of note, Purina did an independent assessment of Blue Buffalo after the claim was made that BB has no filler.  It simply is not true.",

They did blood test and poop test and everything came back healthy. Considering we don’t have a yard and walk the dogs everyday ourselves, I know they don’t get into anything. Once the vet recommended a bland diet and to switch his food to nature balance we have not seen any issues!! Also I may add a friend of ours was feeding his dog the same food and his dog passed away from liver failure. After doing research there are other cases of small dogs dying after eating blue!

That being said, I've had this a part of my amazon subscribe and save forever but the last time something was terribly off.Half way into finishing the bag my dog got seriously sick, lost a lot of her hair and even her appetite. She started chewing furiously all herself all over her body and eventually she would smell the kibble and walk away which she never does. At first I thought maybe fleas or mange or something of the sort but after getting her checked out nothing was wrong with her in that sense.I inspected her food and it definitely smelled different than before. I decided to check the reviews on Amazon and saw similar complaints... well I dumped out the entire bag and decided to grab a small bag of the same brand and flavor and what do you know, she ate it like she hadn't seen food in forever.I smelled the new bag of blue buffalo that I purchased from the store and it didnt smell bad at all unlike the one I got from amazon.A few days after feeding her the bag from the store she already had major improvement in her mood and appetite and her hair started growing back. No more biting like crazy either.Needless to say I canceled my amazon subscribe and save and will be getting it from the store from now on. In fact I refuse to buy anything on Amazon that our family ingests or puts on our bodies like lotions and whatnot anymore. I don't know ir its a bad batch or a fake product or what but it's just not worth the risk.",

We thought we found that with this food.  Though it does not cause a rash we have even worse issues.  It started with our beagle.  He never wanted to eat this food so we would soften it with water and he begrudgingly ate.  Then with the last couple bags we received he started have bloody loose stools.  We changed his food and the problem went away, but we kept feeding the Blue Buffalo to our hound mix with the grain allergy.  Everything seemed good until we opened the most recent bag we received and the hound started having bloody, loose stools.  As we had seen this before with our beagle we immediately switched our hound to another food and the problem went away.I don't know if this is a quality control issue, changing of source ingredients or something else but I will no longer be using this food and will not recommend it to anyone.I've switched my dogs to ranchers choice from the local agriculture supply store.  Not only is it half the price but both my dogs eat without hesitation and they are noticeably more energetic.",

We noticed a similar occurrence with Taste of The Wild a year or so ago too. It seemed to be Amazon specific too. People had posted a variance in the kibble sizes from the bags bought from Amazon in contrast to some other retailer like Tractor Supply. Not sure what’s going on. Even though we love the option of Prime delivering 30+ pound bags of dog food to our door, I think we’ll be buying from our local Pet Emporium and let the experts guide us on brands for now.",

Vet thinks its from mold in her food. ****Our dog right now is on a IV at the vets and they are trying to keep her alive. She has been very sick since consuming the last bag of Blue that came from Amazon two weeks ago....If you read on you’ll find that other dogs and their owners are experiencing the same thing. I really hope that Blue Buffalo will refund our vet bill because they can in no way give our dog her life back if we loose her.I’ve received five emails from Amazon since 6:30 PM last night. I’ll post a picture of that below as to save anyone else from going though what we are.My dog has eaten this exact food for maybe six years without any issues and we always order from Amazon so I’m not certain what happened with this batch. You can also read consumer affairs the reports from the last 2 to 3 weeks about this food to be the same as the complaints here on Amazon. For whatever reason this food is making some dogs very very ill. Are started with vomiting, losing weight, being lethargic and then blood in her stool. Are smaller dog ate about a half of a handful of it and became sick as well, not the food we normally feed him so he was switched back over instantly.....Don’t risk it!!! Of course we tried to call the blue Buffalo number and they won’t be open again for phone calls until Monday and I got that email after they were already closed on a Friday night :(Younger dog may bounce back more quickly but due to my dogs age they aren’t sure she is going to pull through. She has jaundice and her liver is not working properly...She was a perfectly healthy dog before eating this last batch of food.",

After starting on the second bag (both purchased through Amazon), one of our dogs got terribly sick (vomiting profusely and bloody diarrhea), so sick we had to take her to a 24 hour vet clinic.  Blood work, full exam, stool sample, you name it, they were stumped.  We got a couple of prescriptions for her and fed her a bland diet of boiled chicken and white rice.  She improved.  Once she improved, the other 3 began to get sick.  In a week's time, they all lost a noticeable amount of weight from vomiting so much and not eating.  I went to the pet store and purchased a different brand of dog food.  When I gave it to them, they all scarfed it down immediately.  They wouldn't even go near the Blue Buffalo food.  Not only would we like a refund for the full bag of food that I have and will not give my dogs, but we would also like to be reimbursed for the vet bills we incurred due to this food!  DO NOT buy this food, it will make your dogs sick!!!",

Delivery guy had a hard time getting it to the door, and we had an equally hard time picking it up.  Why not just use a smaller box that fits the product?  Other than this time, packaging has been good, price is good, and convenience of delivery is good.",

My two dogs will gobble anything up except for this food especially this last order. When I opened the box, it was wrapped in paper which wasn’t done on previous orders. Then, I saw kibbles everywhere and found a hole in the bag. The product was so stale, different color and hard as rocks. There’s no way my Shih-Tzus teeth can handle it and this time around they’re not willing to give it a try. Otherwise, it’s a great price if the food would be fresh and just like the one purchased at pet stores. I wonder if this is why I had a $700 vet bill last time, but I can’t risk another one or worst.",

After speaking to my vet he recommended to stop using the food with life source bits due to a class action lawsuit over them causing lead poisoning and health issues in dogs.  I recently had a dog die that had ate this food her entire life and illness is covered under the lawsuit.  Amazon refused to issue a refund on the food because I was beyond the 30 day window.  I have been a faithful Amazon Prime customer for years and have two Amazon credit cards.  Very disappointed in the customer service I received as a long time faithful customer!!!",

Shortly after we switched over to this, we noticed that our dog would throw up about once every three to five days. We changed a lot of other things (we cut out all treats and monitored her closely outside to make sure she wasn't getting into something she wasn't supposed to) and still it continued to happen. As a last effort before going to the vet with the problem, we stopped using this food and the throwing up stopped. We have been off the food for a little over a month and we have not had one other throw up incident. We like Blue Buffalo but something about their diet formula was detrimental to our dogs health. I do not recommend this product.",

They said it was a stomach bug and gave her antibiotics - almost hospitalizing her because of her dehydration.After two weeks, I started adding blue buffalo back to her diet. Barely made it three days before the blood happened AGAIN. Went back to the vet - who immediTely asked what food she's on. The second I said blue buffalo he goes 'Ya type in blue buffalo blood on goggle and then throw that stuff out'",

My dogs only eat grain free Blue Buffalo Basic, and I was looking for a different flavor from this line, but I bought this specific bag by accident. Every single time we’ve tried slowly introducing a different brand dog food, grain free or not, my Frenchie has an instant, horrible allergic reaction with intense itching and he’s covered in breakouts that have to be medically treated for days after discontinuing use of the food. I’m pretty convinced I’ve actually created the allergy issue by only feeding him grain free food from a puppy, also because a milder version of this experience also happens now to our other dog that was a 14 month old rescue with no known allergies when we got her, and I’m certain the Humane Society as wonderful as they are, were not providing the dogs with grain free food lol, but that’s another topic. I had every intention on returning this bag and getting the correct one but my boyfriend didn’t realize it and already fed it to our 4 dogs. After I realized they had been eating it for 2 days, I noticed that our Frenchie only had a very mild visible allergic skin reaction I had to search for, but he didn’t display any discomfort or agitation. None of our other dogs showed any skin irritation or digestive issues after eating this food, like they would with another brands grain free food. I still switched them back to the Blue Buffalo Basic, but now it makes me wonder if they are just a reaction to grains, or if it’s something else that’s in other brand dog food they’re reacting to, if the reactions are from the other brands having lower quality ingredients than Blue Buffalo, or something I haven’t thought of. Either way, Blue Buffalo grain free or with grains have only ever proven to be an amazing pet food brand with products that I can trust and I will be forever loyal to.The flavor from this Blue Buffalo line of dog food specifically, my dogs and I were very happy with and I would highly recommend.",

Maybe they changed their formula, I dunno. She was going outside to go poop 5 or 6 times a day, minimum. She used to go just twice a day, after breakfast and after dinner. Plus, it was like soft serve ice cream, mushy and hard to pick up. And clearly her bottom was irritated, she was licking it a lot. Super gross, all the way around.So I decided to try this Blue formula. I used to have a cat with health problems that did really well on the Blue brand so trying it for my dog was an easy decision. We started with a 25/75 new/old food ratio and by the time we were 50/50 I noticed a difference. Her poops were more solid and there were less of them. It is day 1 of just this new food now. She has been out to go potty twice, and only pooped right after breakfast, and I am thrilled! Again, TMI but it is harder, drier poop. Easier to pick up and doesn't smell as gross either.Even though it is spendier than the Costco food, ordering thru Amazon was cheaper than any local store's sale price and I love that it came to my door, rather than me schlepping it in and out of a cart, my car and up the stairs to my place. But we are so happy with this food that I dont mind paying more and would gladly schlepp it anywhere!",

I know you can't compromise on quality, but it would be nice if the prices would come down a bit and that is one of the only reasons I would switch to a more afforadable brands with similar ingredients.",

So far so good although at first a little bit of softer stool. Thought I will totally shift her over to this brand as when mixed with old brand she actually picks out the Blue Buffoalo! Smart girl (1/2 border collie.) However after getting her 100% over for a week, her stools were soft to the point of runny. switched back to Taste of the Wild (quick had gotten better reviews when I fist looked for a food for her) and problem went away.  Now using Taste of the Wild again adding a little chicken or beef broth (use both Venison and Salmon flavors) . So, can't argue that Blue Buffalo tasted good but have to say dog's stomach demonstrate that it can be a problem at least for us.",

A few things about the Blue brand: not all Blues are created equal. The Blue Wilderness has a 5-Star rating from DogFoodAdvisor, while Life Protection (this one) has a 4-Star. To quote Advisor: “Blue Buffalo Life Protection is a plant-based dry dog food using a moderate amount of chicken, turkey or fish meals as its main sources of animal protein, thus earning the brand 4 stars. Highly recommended.”So, it would be nice if there were a little more meat in the recipe, but my dogs have no digestion or allergy issues with this food, and they love it. A-",

We have since changed over to BLUE because it is the brand of food that our cats have preferred. After six months, our dachshund is back to his normal weight yet we still find him running over to the dog with delight because he loves it!The kibble  is a great size for small and large dogs alike and I appreciate that there isn't a heavy stench of dog food.

We recently decided to buy her food from Amazon because it was cheaper, but ever since we started this bag, she's been throwing up and her tummy won't stop gurgling. We didn't change anything else in her diet, and we have never really given her people food. We decided to take her to the vet and everything looked fine according to them. So, in conclusion, I don't know for sure that the food caused it, but after reading some other reviews on here, I will be throwing the rest out and buying blue buffalo at PetSmart. Hopefully no other doggos get sick.",

Usually they would eat it all immediately, but they started leaving food in the bowl all day long. We figured maybe they were sick of the food, so we switched to a different flavor. The bag had holes in it but there wasn’t a whole lot of food that had fallen out of the box so we decided not to make a fuss. Well ever since we started using this “flavor” they have had awful gas every day. I’m hoping their stomachs don’t hurt along with the gas. It can’t be anything else. I’ve seen a few comments about other people having the same issues with their dogs eating habits.",

She's a year old now so we switched to Diamond Naturals Adult but it still didn't change much. This Blue Buffalo food has completely stopped her cough and throwing up! and SHE LOVES IT. With the other food she was never in a hurry to eat and would pick at it when she was hungry. We put this food in her bowl and she goes to town! She's been on it a week and I have YET to hear her cough...which was a daily symptom. Well worth the money.",

Less fillers, better for the dog, etc. it was also 3 times the price. We've been using it for maybe 1 1/2 years. He likes it, and no issues.This last bag we purchased though is now smelling up our back room, where we store it. It also smells up the kitchen where the dog's bowl is located. We're back to that fishy smell again...It's very frustrating. We upgraded to BB dog food to get away from the low rent food. I'm really curious what they're putting in these foods for protein. It's supposed to be lamb and rice. It smells more like old cheese and rotten fish...",

When you make fish and rice recipe, you need to use a different kind of fat besides chicken. There are a large percentage of dogs with a chicken allergy lately, so beef, pork or vegetable fat would be a better choice than what this company has chosen. Also, maybe have an updated ingredient list provided for the consumer, so we all know what we are giving our family member, our dog .",

This dog food is under investigation and some finds were that 3 “flavors” contained lead. They aren’t saying which 3 just yet but how terrifying is that they would continue to sell it knowing it contained lead and knowing dogs are getting sick or dying bc of it. I passed on it and bought the Acana today instead.",

For that being said the food is very good quality and my dog does love it. Just wish they had more choices so my puppy doesn't have to eat the same flavor for a year. That must get boring.",

            "review_text": "Update: Since my original review, we have switched away from Blue Buffalo. One of our girls developed a severe skin reaction, but the other two pups were fine. When my husband brought the pup with the reaction to the vet, the vet told him she had seen many patients recently with the same reaction from Blue Buffalo products. I do not buy this product strictly from Amazon, so I don't think it's necessarily an issue with them. Furthermore, our other two dogs seemed to be unaffected. So, there is no guarantee that the reaction occurred from this food, but we are switching her away to be safe.My two female boxers really enjoy this food and are doing great with it. Our pups previously ate this formula. However, after some bad press we heard about this brand, we switched them to Taste of the Wild. Unfortunately, our one pup was allergic to their formula, so we had to make a switch again at the advice of our vet. She said to give Blue Buffalo another shot, so we did. We're very happy with the results we're seeing. Our pups are maintaining a healthy weight and have lots of energy!",

There must be something in it that causes an allergy, I would hate to believe the other comments suggesting Amazon tampers with the food and its fraudulent.  To make the case, we started feeding him the food about 2 months ago, he started having discolored stools but we thought he maybe ate a toy or something. A couple weeks later, I took him to the vet. They ran blood work, he was fine, so they gave him antibiotics and a bland diet of plain rice and boiled chicken, he started doing better so we reintroduced the kibble.  He has had full blown bloody diarrhea and vomiting.  He has stopped eating, he has lost 5 pounds and he is extremely thirsty bc he is so dehydrated.  We switched him back to rice and boiled chicken, and he is feeling better within hours.  I feel awful for feeding him this garbage poison!!  Stay away from this line of blue buffalo!!!!",

            "review_text": "I really like the Blue Buffalo brand. I work for a small pet feed store and even with my 20% discount at work, I get a better deal here. We currently feed the Whitefish and brown rice flavor.  I read another review where the reviewer stated that the bag they received from Amazon did not have a pungent fish aroma like bags bought elsewhere. FYI  If you purchase the fish flavor, it should NOT smell strongly of fish. When you get the strong fishy smell, that is because the fish oils in the product have turned rancid.  Fish oils can turn rancid pretty quickly, so if you receive a bag that has no odor, trust that you have gotten a very fresh bag. A slight fish odor is normal. Slight being the key word here. It should not be overpowering.On to flavor choices. When choosing a flavor or meat source for your dog food, you need to first consider whether your dog needs a \"hot\" protein or a \"cold\" protein based on their specific health needs/personality.  This subject can get very deep and intricate, so it is highly recommended to learn and investigate to fully understand the subject. Food has intrinsic properties that can help balance bodily energy. So dogs who tend toward an overbalance of “hot” energy should consume cooling foods, while those who tend to be \"cold\" in nature should consume warming foods.For example, my lab suffers from anxiety (hot energy). We used to feed the lamb formula, knowing nothing about hot or cold proteins at the time. As it turns out, lamb is one of the hottest proteins available. This was actually making his anxiety worse. We worked with a trainer who suggested switching the flavor of food we fed and gave us information about hot and cold proteins.  By switching his food to the Whitefish flavor, which is cooling, we have seen a drastic improvement in his anxiety levels. Sometimes I am still in awe as to how something as simple as switching the main source of protein in his diet has helped him so much. This also goes for many dogs with allergies, the flavor you are feeding could be the culprit!If you are switching from another brand of food, please take your time and acclimate your dog or puppy slowly! Blue Buffalo is very rich in protein so it is important that you switch your dogs food gradually from his current food to avoid digestive upset or tummy trouble. (This goes for all brands, not just switching to Blue) To transition, mix your dog’s current food with his new food. Over 7 days, gradually decrease the amount of the current dog food while increasing the amount of new dog food. Using this method for transitioning, I have had great results. Day 1 & 2  25% new and 75% current. Days 3 & 4  50% new with 50% current, Days 5 & 6 75% new to 25% current and on the 7th day I feed 100% new. Every dog is different and some need a few extra days to acclimate. Watch their stools each day to decide if you should increase the % of new food.",

They have multiple sized bags and formmulas. So needless to say, I haven't set foot in a pet store to buy food since I found this.

She was a picky eater, but when my mother in law watched her she had no problem eating her dogs food which is Blue Buffalo, so we switched her food. I was shocked on how regular she became and her coat was softer and shiner then it has ever been. The doctor had us put her on Omega 3 for her liver. It had not helped bring it down. After awhile on Blue Buffalo it has gone down 3 times the amount. She went from 405 to 186. I am sure the Omega helped some, but I feel confident that BB had a huge impact because 6 months after taking Omega her levels had not gone down and she was on another food at that time. Both of my dogs love this food. She is not picky about BB.",

            "review_text": "I have been buying blue buffalo dog food for almost two years.  My dog loved it until two months ago. She stopped wanting to eat. She walks everyday for an hour and a half so she is always hungry.  I knew something was wrong, I brought her to the vets they ran blood work, stool sample and could not find anything. She has been having diarrhea for the past few weeks. Then yesterday morning threw up all of her food. I went online and read reviews about people purchasing dog food on amazon and having the same issues I am having.  I am a faithful amazon shopper.  But I am very disappointed.  I now have a large amount of dog food that I purchased and is going to get thrown out. I purchased a bag of dog food (different brand) at a local store, filled her bowl up and she ate the whole thing like her old self. Is it something wrong with blue buffalo or the way it is being stored/shipped? I would prefer to order my dog food through amazon as it is more convenient but my dogs health is more important to me. Please fix this problem amazon  so that I can again order her food through amazon.",

When we took our new adopted Pit Bull in for her first checkup, we were asked what we were feeding her.  We proudly said that we were feeding Blue Buffalo poultry and brown rice.  The response was immediate.  Stop feeding it, don't use any Blue Buffalo products and use the Science Diet she was getting at the shelter.  He said that they are seeing problems with the Blue Buffalo causing vomiting and diahheria (sp).  We had actually seen her vomit that morning, but figured she had eaten something in the yard that didn't agree with her.  For those of you getting a good result, that's awesome!  But since even the product description says to consult your vet, we are going to go with the advice of our vet and stop feeding this product.  I was disappointed because not only did I think I was feeding a healthy food, I also thought I was supporting a product made in the USA.  From now on, we will ask first before making a diet change instead of after.",

After 3 days of giving the food ,my dog was vomiting a lot of saliva and losing a lot of hair.  We took him to emergency room, he was hospitalized for 2 nights ($$$), the diagnosis results showed that we was fine (blood analysis and fecal) , but dehydrated.  They then RX canned food (digestive something), he was fine for a week till the food was over and as we started mixing the blue buffalo with the canned food.  Vomiting again... We changed to another brand (Wellness core) and now he is fine and energized, best of all happy.",

After doing more research, I've found other dog owners with the same issues and most of the time worse than my dogs! I'm pulling them off the food immediately. Please research this product before feeding it to your dogs. My dogs have never had health issues and this is the FIRST time they've gotten Hot spots.  Blue Buffalo = vet bills and sick dogs. :(",

Normally he is fine on BB and we generally buy this exact mix from PetSmart (he has been on this food since he was a puppy and he's now 8). He has a sensitive stomach anyways, but we've noticed that when we have switched to using these bags from Amazon he does NOT feel good and just paces around and he has thrown up/had some gross poo. I would not recommend buying this product off of Amazon. I'm not sure if it's due to storage conditions or perhaps how old the food is, but his upset stomach when switching over to this online bag is too coincidental for me to use this anymore. Our beagle who also eats this has of course been fine, but he eats poop so we don't trust his judgement and stomach of steel.",

My  dog developed acute pancreatitis and had to be hospitalized a couple months after switching  to Blue Buffalo Small Bites Chicken and Rice.  She had no prior health issues and did not get into anything else in the house; the only change in her diet was the kibble.  The vet advised she has seen several cases of acute pancreatitis in healthy dogs where owners reported their dogs did not eat anything not intended for them. The vet pointed out that I may want to take into consideration that the only common factor in the cases she had seen recently was that all of the dogs were on some Blue Buffalo formula.  That may not be solid evidence for some but after having my dog go from healthy to having sudden diarrhea, rectal bleeding and dehydration (not to mention the $1000 bill for medical care) I threw out the remaining half of the bag and went back to Royal Canin.",

After switching my older dog is hooked! For $50 a bag it can get pricey but it is definitely worth it. A couple months back I didn't have the money to buy this bag so I got a bag of pedigree and they would not touch it! Idk if they knew the difference in the food or just got spoiled with the good stuff but I had to go out the next day and get this bag.. I did find that it is cheaper to get it from amazon as opposed to Petco or Petsmart. I've checked both stores and even though I'm a rewards member at both places amazon still sells is for roughly $10/15 cheaper.",

It is starting to get better right away, now she also finished her first 24 Lbs bag, rarely see her chewing her paws, and her stool is firm, easy to pick up. A recent visit to the vet diagnosed a stomach bug( not because of the dog food). It was caused by a bacteria and so the vet suggested we add a probiotic \n\nVitapet Probiotic Powder Blend For Dogs and Cats with 5 Billion CFU Per Serving\n\n  . She thinks she is  getting a treat. I sprinkle this in her food and this keeps her from getting diarrhea and vomiting. It is less costly to order online and worth every penny to not have sick puppies. !!!",

I found this great omega product \n\nVitapet Omega Fish Oil Chewables with EPA and DHT for Dogs with CoQ10\n\n  . These chews are great! We give them to all of our dogs and they love them! I bought them for my beagle, who sheds like crazy! She's been eating them for 2 weeks and I would like to say that I have seen a significant decrease in hair loss. She has high anxiety which doesn't help with the hair loss but these seem to really help.  I also want to take a minute to say what an incredible company this is. Your customer service is fantastic. You offer suggestions, and never hesitate to offer assistance if there is any need. I would buy from no one else. I referred you just the other day to a new puppy owner. Keep up the great service and thank you!",

Our senior citizen dog (13 years old) used to throw up multiple times a day and the vet told us it was probably allergies and to give her benadryl, but that didn't work. We decided to give Blue Buffalo a try after reading great reviews from other customers and from watching their informative great commercials.Well needless to say....we love Blue Buffalo and it is the only food we have been feeding our dogs for almost 2 years! Our senior citizen has completely stopped throwing up and all of our 3 dogs have shiny coats and a lot more energy then they used to on their old food. We used to buy the food from PetSmart but Amazon has it for $20 dollars LESS!If you want to feed your dogs great quality food at a pretty great price then I recommend this product!!",

This is also the only dog food I have purchased online so that may have something to do with it?",

It was getting tough having him eat a whole bag of something he wasn't interested in, but I couldn't afford to throw out a new bag.  I finally caught this at a decent price on amazon and he DESTROYED the first bowl without hesitation and wanted more!  He typically eats 1.5 cups in the AM and 1.5 in the pm.  It was awesome to see him finally interested in a food and not push it around all day.He has had quite dry skin with the previous brand I was buying, so I'm hoping this food will change that a bit.  Hes only on his first day of the food, but I can already tell he will be sticking with this Blue Buffalo.  It is a little pricier than I like to pay, but the dog is family and it's great to see him enjoy meal time.",

We stopped at PetSmart and a sales person came over to pet Lady. Lady totally loves people so she was jumping all over the sales lady and licking her face.Eventually she was like \"you have an awesome dog. What do you feed her?\"I said Purina.\"That's like the McDonald's of dog food\"I said \"I know it's unhealthy but you have no idea how hard it was to find something she would actually eat. If she doesn't like a food she just sniffs her bowl and walks away and she'll starve herself for days. I was feeling like a terrible doggy mom before we found Purina.\"\"I am going give you a few sample bags of some healthy dog food and I bet you she'll eat them!\"Of the three samples, Lady would not eat a single one she would put it in her mouth and spit it back on the floor (2 flavors were Simply Nurish and 1 flavor was Nutro).This story was just to illustrate how hard it's been to find something Lady will eat. A few weeks ago our Vet said that she was getting a little chunky and I've been following the directions on the Purina package to the letter (Lady is 1 year old so she is very energetic and she gets a good amount of exercise and she NEVER gets people food) so he said we needed to switch foods because that was the likely culprit.Tried this Blue Buffalo and she adores it!",

We give no people food either.  She had been eating the large dog version of this that we feed our GS.  It packed the pounds on her before we knew it.  After 3 months on the allowed feeding schedule of this, and no treats whatsoever,  she has lost a total of 6 pounds.  She looks great, is more active and I can actually hold her in my arms longer.  My only complaint is the little bunny turd looking hard nuggets they put in the food.  The first 2 weeks on this, she was spitting them all over the floor,  it looked like we had a bunny on the loose.  She eats it all now.",

With this, I can barely get it into her bowl.  She is more alert and energized also.  Great for a 9 year old Boxer.  She will sit there and bug me for more but knows she can't have it.  LOL  I would definitely recommend!!!!",

            "review_text": "This is going to sound biased, but bear with me.My pup Bagsby (11 month old pit mix) is amazing and I love him to death. I knew as soon as I adopted him that I wanted to do what was best for him, and this included buying the right dog food. My dad works for Blue Buffalo (I know, again, sounds biased), but he has also worked for Iams, Doane and Kent. I called him when I got Bagsby and I asked him for his honest opinion of what dog food to buy. He told me to buy Blue Buffalo Life Protection Formula. I asked if it was because he was working for them now, and he told me that this wasn't the case--it really is the best dog food. Keep in mind my dad has been in the industry for 30+ years. Well, I bought it and haven't looked back. My dog's coat is shiny and soft, his energy levels are good, his weight is fine and he is overall very healthy. He absolutely loves his food, and he maintains perfect weight with a reasonable amount of food. As far as price goes, I honestly haven't even thought about it. I literally bought him Blue Buffalo and haven't changed it.I highly recommend Blue Buffalo. Don't feed your dog junk...they're your buddy and your family. Even if you have to spend a couple extra bucks, trust me, it's worth it. It's an amazing product!",

            "review_text": "I do not normally self diagnose but with all the reviews I have read and the problems my dog is having I will never feed this to her again. Luna is a female golden only 5 months old. We have been giving her this food from the day we brought her home. About a month ago some weird stuff started happening to her, it started with a rash, kind of like pimples on her belly and behind/in her ears. We took her in to the vet and the vet gave us antibacterial shampoo to bathe her in. It didn't do squat. Then she started to vomit occasionally, I just thought it was her being a dumb puppy eating stuff she shouldn't. Then came the diarrhea, she couldn't control it, not fun to clean mind you. After getting concerned I started reading reviews on another website on blue buffalo. I found out they were taken to court for false advertisement by Purina after Purina tested their food to see if it really contained the ingredient they claimed. Well it didn't, it contains more (meal) than most other pet foods. Then I find out they out sourced manufacturing to China so who knows what they put in the food now. Back to my dog not wanting to eat her food, she wouldn't touch the food, Luna is the kind of dog that would eat your hand if it was in the bowl while she was eating so I know she isn't picky. So I went and bought another brand of food to test my theory and other peoples as well. I put some in her food dish and she still wouldn't touch it! After reading a bit more someone had the same issue except the next time they put it in a different dish so it wouldn't have the same smell as the blue buffalo food and their dog ate it right up. So I tried the same thing and she ate no problem. The symptoms are gone but I sure as well will never use BB or recommend it to anyone else again. I felt I should share this story for other people experiencing the same problems, mind you not every person is having these issues but there are lots that are.",

            "review_text": "Blue Buffalo dog food appeals to any dog owner no matter the size or breed. Blue Buffalo provides dog food options of various flavors, dog breeds and age of a dog. They have dog food for large, small, young, and old dogs. Blue Buffalo does an excellent job providing dog foods that are specified for certain needs, but also general diets. Blue Buffalo is a safe, healthy product to feed any dog. It does not contain any by-product meal, corn, wheat, or artificial flavors.The kibble size ranges from the size of an eraser to about the size of a nickel. My dog has never had issues breaking up the puppy or the adult dog food. Blue Buffalo does provide the option of soft dog food if your dog has any issue biting or chewing on hard foods.I usually purchase the 15 pound bag of dog food and it lasts me about 30-35 days. My dog is around 25 pounds and eats a cup of food in the morning and night. This will vary between owner because of different breeds and schedules. Basing your decision off of my dog and schedule I hope it helps you decide which size would be best for your dog.Many users may be skeptical to purchase Blue Buffalo because of the price, but I would say it is well worth it. I have often found Blue Buffalo food on sale or coupons in store advertisements. I would recommend shopping around to ensure the best deal on this product.I have found my dog to love this dog food. He has been fed this from puppy to his current age of two. I have tried several different dog food brands and experienced many issues with stool and energy level upon switching away from Blue Buffalo. Once I had changed back to Blue Buffalo, the negative symptoms ceased. I have witnessed a positive change in energy, stool, behavior, and coat while he has been eating Blue Buffalo dog food products.",

I've always checked the bag ingredients on and  off but apparently not often enough. The last bag now shows chicken fat,  turkey meal, and fish. Very disappointed this change occured while the brand still flaunts Lamb and brown rice on the front. This food now contains every meat except beef. We will move to a cleaner label brand now as I can no longer tryst Blue Buffalo's misleading and changing packaging.",

            "review_text": "It's great that it's affordable, but this brand (at least the product being sold online) messed up my dogs so badly. I have a Yorkie- Maltese who began throwing up at least once a day for this entire month. I couldn't wrap my head around why this was happening. He's 11 years old, an older dog, and I had researched he may need to eat less and more often throughout the day to keep him from throwing up and having his stomach empty. It seemed to help at first, but even when he was being fed more often he was still throwing up yellow foam. I also have a german shepherd/retriever mix and he has been itching non-stop and his skin has been irritated and red.I've been looking more closely into the reviews for this product and down to even they way the online brand kibble looks (pale and stale looking) to being store bought (darker colored) there has to be something happening with the online products of this brand. I know that Blue brand is a highly recommended dog food with better ingredients than the grocery store brands of dog food, but I definitely recommend you doing your research before purchasing this brand online. There are so many reviews saying it caused their dogs skin irritation and vomiting and I have witnessed this first hand. Both of my dogs, even the 11-year-old Morkie, are in perfect health with no prior skin irritations or health dificiencies.I recommend purchasing this brand in stores and NOT ONLINE. There are other brands on here that have better reviews that you should look into. I've already ordered the Diamond Brand dog food found here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BVUBBPG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I know purchasing good dog food in a 30 pound (or really any quantity) can be expensive and I am all for purchasing online, but DO YOUR RESEARCH! Good luck!",

I'm glad the dogs are super friendly but I was distressed to see them so thin. I decided I'd splurge in hopes they'd appreciate the dog food and might hang around long enough to keep the squirrels away. Well, only one of the dogs would eat the food! I had to sweeten the pot by adding 1/4 can of soup to the food before they would both get excited about getting fed, AND THEY WERE STARVING!  I switched to purina, less than half the price and they seem to like it a lot more.I guess it's tough to make kids eat their veggies?",

She is also a very picky eater and she eats this with no problem.  One thing to note is that I have heard that the discounted price of the food on Amazon won't be lasting very long and soon the price will be on par with the stores, so reap the savings now while they last!

            "review_text": "Our 7 year old Australian Shepherd was having very severe skin issues.  Our vet couldn't find the cause and suggested to switch foods.  We'd been feeding Merrick & Merrick's cheaper brand Whole Earth Farms for years, never thinking it was the food since his potty time was always fine & other than the skin issues he was in great health.  Being so sick & tired of his poor skin problems I gave Blue Buffalo a shot & I gave it several bags before I made a decision as to if it was helping at all or doing nothing.  I figured the food would probably have nothing to do with any of the skin issues and was just taking a shot in the dark picking Blue Buffalo.  I was absolutely shocked that his skin issues are totally 100% gone now - all cleared up & 100% healed!  Now I do want to be super clear here & state that I honestly believe it was the removal of his old food that was what caused this amazing improvement, not the addition of Blue Buffalo.  Hope that makes sense!I mean that, I think any other good quality food would have very likely caused improvement in his skin issues.  I just happened to choose Blue Buffalo & it just happened to work great for us!  It's good quality nutrition, our Aussie seems to like the taste, it's always available here on Amazon & if for some reason I don't want the Chicken & Rice at any point there are plenty other varieties to choose from.  I really love when pet food companies have various kinds & flavors so we can keep our dog's digestive system regular & give him some variety to keep him excited about food!  We can switch between any of the varieties without any fuss because most of them have very similar ingredients. The biggest positive I can report is, we didn't transition him at all from his old food to Blue Buffalo.  So we were expecting some not-so-great potty results.  Nope!  All went smooth & no changes in his digestive system!  We have ALWAYS had major trouble if we didn't switch him slowly, so I was really surprised nothing happened negatively & his food transition went as easy as pie!  I personally as of now highly recommend Blue Buffalo!",

            "review_text": "I was feeding my dog \"Taste of the Wild\" and he seemed to be enjoying it for the most part. But as weeks progressed I noticed a terrible turn in his stool and his mood. I also noticed he wouldn't eat the food once a put it down, he would leave the food untouched for 2 to 3 days at a time. That's when I started to do more research. I started to compensate with Purina, but that only work for a week or so and it was back to unhealthy stool, lack of eating, downtrodden mood, and even vomiting. I started giving him peeled boiled potatoes, unseasoned white rice, and egg yolk just to put something in his belly. One day I was at home and clear as day I thought \"Blue Buffalo\" I know it was the LORD speaking to me because I had never inquired or researched this specific product. I didn't hesitate, nor did I speculate. I jumped on Amazon and ordered this product which arrived 2 days later. Jackson (my blue nose pit) dove head first into his dog dish leaving no remainings. At first I thought maybe because he really liked it as he does most dog food upon initially trying it. But then I noticed a dramatic change in his stool, in his weight and in his behavior. I waited to see if any bad symptoms would reoccur but nothing happened. Jackson is well and loves his food. 15 pound will last a month and 30 pounds will last 2 months. I still give him the white rice and egg yoke occasionally. Rice puts more weight on him and egg yoke shines his coat something wonderful. Overall, Great dog food. Thank You JESUS and Thanks Amazon",

Arrived in two separate package both damaged and look like re opened and taped again. Once opened both packages had cut in bags ( I assume we're they used knife to open) and food was coming out. In both packaged delivered days apart. The boxes the 30lb were sent in were so flimsily it could not hold the weight. I just spent 30 min picking through all the packaging to retrieve all the loose food. Because as you know while blue buffalo is great for your animals it's expensive.I've never had this problem through Amazon. But I will not order anything heavy again I am not sure they know how to package.",

I have a French bulldog who is almost 10 years old and he is a big fan of all food especially the human variety. The main issue I've always had with him and I know he isn't the only bulldog guilty of this, but he is a VERY gassy little dude. His stomach is so finnacky that I've found no food that can completely conquer the gas problem. This particular brand is well known for being top notch and I'll tell you it's been by far the best dog food I've ever fed my guy. First off he loves it and always dances and jumps when he knows I'm filling his bowl. Secondly, and maybe no less important it has really helped control his gassy reactions to most any food he eats. It's been a god send for me because this guy could clear out one level of my house on most any other food. Needless to say, I highly recommend Blue and this particular variety in particular for your pet.",

I wish I had fed him food of this quality all these years.I made the switch over to Blue Buffalo about a year ago from \n\nTaste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, Hi Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison & Venison, 30-Pound Bag\n\n  . He gobbled up the chicken and brown rice flavor right away. I noticed the following benefits within the first week of feeding him this:1. Noticeable energy - he is up and running around a little more than usual. He also has a more lively look in his eyes.2. Appetite - his appetite neither went up nor down, but I have noticed that he loves this food. At first he ate about a half to a full cup more than I normally give him, but that tapered back down to his normal amount by the end of the first week.3. Digestion - I have purchased both the regular and small bite pellet sizes, and he digests the small bite pellets better. He has had many teeth removed, so I have noticed that the small bite formula is easier on his gums and teeth.Overall, I highly recommend this food. You pay more for it, but I noticed an immediate difference in my dog's health. To me, that's worth the price. If your dog has had teeth removed, then I also recommend their small bite formula.",

She cannot eat just anything and has sensitivities, but has no problem that I can see with this food, except maybe a slight digestive issue. I can recommend this dog food, but I just have a feeling our new little furry one is going to do better on grain-free. We tried Iams which really did not work for her so we are switching her back to this food. The vet recommended a bland diet for two weeks.  When we return her to a regular diet, we need to leave this food behind and likely will switch to grain-free or limited-ingredient type of kibble at least for a while until we know what is giving her the skin and digestive problems.",

After about 8 months, our dog had been experiencing an inordinate amount of ear infections, and then one day he decided he didn't want to eat his Iams anymore. We tried everything to get him to eat and he wouldn't. Finally we decided to switch to Blue Buffalo, which we wanted to give him from the start but were talked out of, and he immediately loved it. He's been on it for about 7 months now and hasn't had a single ear infection, his energy is better, his coat is much shinier and softer, and he's much more regular in his bowel movements. We can't recommend Blue Buffalo enough. It's the only food we'll feed our pets from now on.",

We were told that she was fed a store brand generic food, which she would gobble down as fast as she could when it was in front of her.  After a few weeks we started having issues with our new family member, it seemed like every other day she was having a seizure which usually occurred a few hours after her food was eaten.  After numerous vet appointments the suggestion was made to give her a better food, so after quite a bit of research we settled on Blue Buffalo.  I am happy to say that we have now had our Baby Girl for 5 years and we have been seizure free since the switch.  I can honestly say you get for what you pay for in this case, she has more energy, her coat looks 100% better, and she no longer gobbles down her food, but enjoys it throughout the day. I highly recommend Blue to anyone that has a dog or cat, its simply one of the best foods on the market.  Thank You Blue for helping our little girl and making her a permanent part of our family.",

I cut her food portions down drastically while she was on this particular food, as she gained some weight and her potty's were bad. That is the only reason for the 4 stars, as since then, I have switched her to the Healthy Weight Turkey in Blue Buffalo and she has been much better.

This is the first bag that I purchased from Amazon, and within 2 weeks of her starting to eat it, she was having trouble urinating. I took her to the vet to find out that she has a bladder infection and crystals in her urine more than likely caused by her dog food. The vet said that Blue Buffalo in general has been causing this in dogs and cats, but since I have never had a problem before I am beginning to believe that the Amazon food is the cause of her problems. Now she has to eat perscription food. BUYER BEWARE!",

We changed her to Orijen Adult dog food 1 day ago and are giving her NuPath digestive to calm her system and the difference is amazing.  She is calmer and she loves the food, her breath is already sweeter and her poop is solid and much less stinky.  Will NEVER give her Blue Buffalo again it's bad dog food.",

            "review_text": "My dogs love this stuff. I have a Boston terrier and a (wait for it) a Basset-Doodle... Bassetoodle? Basset-poo? Poodle Hound? Well, anyway, she's half Basset Hound and half miniature poodle, making her 100% French, and kind of picky. The food her breeder (I know, hard to imagine what they were thinking) had been feeding her was full of food coloring (and possibly roadkill)... That poor puppy threw up every day until I switched her to Blue Buffalo. My Boston is a little sensitive to wheat, so I needed to accommodate their very different issues if possible. Both of my dogs are seniors now, though I feed them this regular adult dog formula, and very healthy. Amazon tends to have a great price on this product.Here's the reason for only four stars, and not five. The good news -- buying from Amazon means I don't have to drive (28 miles) to a specialty pet supply place, somehow get help to convey a heavy bag off the shelf, cart it through the store and hoist it into my car. HOWEVER, and this might be the only downside, I get it delivered to my PO Box. Both the postmaster and I wish it could be shipped to my front door -- it's super heavy, and neither one of us is all that strong. She refuses to lift it at all. So, I get to drag it through the post office, out the heavy door, hoist it into my car, and unload it myself at the house... In summary, delivery to my front porch would earn this Amazon offering five stars in my book!",

I mixed in some pumpkin and she ate the food. She threw up. We thought she was having stomach issues. We decided to switch to the Blue Buffalo Salmon. We were mixing 1/4 cups Salmon with 3/4 cup white fish and sweet potato to transition her off. She was throwing up violently and had diarrhea. We took her to emergency care and she was admitted to the hospital on and off for a week. They did x-rays and and ultrasound and found no foreign bodies. They said it was something she ate. Amazon was nice enough to give us a heads up that the food we bought had been recalled. I called Blue Buffalo and they were on the defense with canned answers. \"we are not vets\" \"there is no proof our dog food made your dog sick\" they said there is nothing they can do to help. After $4000 in vet bills and our dog who is 2 years old is still on meds after almost a week and can't hold her pee.",

His vet gave him antibiotics but they kept coming back. I was recommended Blue Buffalo and within 2 weeks the rashes disappeared and never came back. His fur is shinier and he is much more active. I like that I can alternate between their lamb and chicken without him having any stomach issues, since it's the same food. Definitely recommend this food for pets!If you are going to buy the fish one, buy a smaller bag to test it out. My beagle hated the fish, which is a big deal since beagles are known to devour any food you put in front of them.",

We've had our very picky boxer fella that we think is about 2yrs old (he was a rescue, so it's just a guess) for a year and this is the first time he runs to his food bowl with enthusiasm!  He's never been food driven, and most of the time would just leave his food in his bowl until late in the evening when it was obvious he was just starving.  We've used Taste of the Wild and Kirkland dog food in the past and even tried some add ins (pumpkin and plain yogurt) but he was never interested.  Now when we get up in the morning he waits to be fed, goes immediately to his bowl and goes to town!  This is the very first time we've been able to get him to eat twice a day!  I highly recommend this dog food...it's a WINNER!!",

The ingredients are above the rest at a great price. One 30 lb bag lasts about a month or two. My dog gets about 3 cups daily, 1.5 in the morning etc. Bowels are always solid and healthy.. I typically get a different flavor each time I buy to switch it up and to get a different variety of tastes/nutrients. Also their wilderness line is also incredible. If you care about what your dog eats you should definitely join the millions that prefer blue. I was NOT paid for the review nor do I work for them or any pet supply company.. Only the best for my boyUpdate; not sure why the bag comes ripped in the corners sometimes from a razor blade.. Kibble strewn about on the inside of the box.. Makes me wonder how much kiddies I'm NOT getting... You guys need to effing fix this lack of competence!! One more ripped bag I'll take away all stars.. See attached pics! Pisses me off",

The vet asked what I was feeding, told him Blue Buffalo. He says that is the problem, this stuff is not for dogs, unless they are highly active or a wolf. Stop feeding it. So I did, I have already spent over $2000 on vet bills, and now my dog has to have expensive heart medicine the rest of her life. You can check online about the law suit where Blue was sued for not having the ingredients they claim it has. It is sad that a company sells high priced \"food\" and that is bad for your pet.",

After we got our Shiba Inu, who was raised off of Blue Buffalo, our Corgi mix would steal his food! Now we buy the 30 lb bags off of Amazon (free shipping with our Amazon Prime) and it lasts our dogs about two months. I had read some reviews of dogs getting sick from eating Blue Buffalo because of high zinc content, I will keep an eye out on our dogs, but no problems as of yet.",

She basically said that you cannot trust the list of ingredients, which is sad. So you are paying for a better brand of dog food, but you are not truly getting that quality with Blue Buffalo.",

            "review_text": "This is not the same product sold in stores such as Petsmart. My dog got major food allergies and I had to spend over $500 to help him recover. When I first bought it I was so glad that it was much less than the store price and as he started to eat it he started to nibble on his feet alot and then it just started getting worse and was tearing the skin off all 4 of his feet. I took him to the vet and had to do multiple testing to figure out what exactly the problem was. Then the vet said it was most likely food allergies and I had to put him on a veterinary diet that pretty much healed him with multiple rounds of medications. After some time I decided to look at and read the packaging of this product a little more. I noticed that the package was completely different and I assumed since it was coming from some other location that it was different. Then I started to notice that the food even looked a little different. The pebbles were a different size than the one you can buy at Petsmart as well. This is a replica of the original Blue Buffalo brand and I couldn't believe that it was endorsed by them. I'm beginning to wonder if I should even continue using Blue Buffalo brand because it is so hyped up by the media. There are many other brands that are far better than blue buffalo and more natural and safe. I am not recommending buying dog food from any online store because you really don't know where its coming from and where it's made. At least you know you can return it at a pets store if you buy it from there without having to pay return shipping or pay any restocking fees. If you really care about your dog and if you really don't care about your dog (maybe you shouldn't have one) then get what's best for them because they are innocent creatures and all they want to do is make you happy and you are the most important thing to them in this world.",

We did weight reduction for 2 weeks and she slimmed down to her goal weight. Trying to prevent back problems. She is on weight maintenence poration now and this small bag will probably last her another month or two so a good bargain if you have a small dog to feed.",

I love my girls and I want the best for them and for them to live forever ( as long as possible). As a pet parent it is my duty to feed them well and with Blue I can. Amazon's subscription price makes this an affordable alternative and is a better price than the pet store. Thank you, Blue, for making such a good dog food.",

Our 2 large dogs and 4 small dogs ate the food and their fur and skin was much healthier. We had all our dogs and cats changed to BB in about Nov. so it has been almost 3 months. We now have decided to change food because our dogs and cats stopped using the potty regularly. Just a few days ago we took one cat to the vet and she had a UTI combined with swollen/inflamed bowels. Never had we had problems before, until BB. I didn't want to wait until any of my other cats or dogs got sick so we just threw out all the BB food. I had read the bad reviews here on amazon but I didn't think that such a well known brand of food could be bad. I figured the reviews were probably just lies to try and sway people to another brand, or that maybe it was just a coincidence that certain pets got sick-not because of BB. But now I saw for myself that although this food is good, it is actually too good; its not balanced which can cause issues in the animals. Do research on BB before you decide whether its the right fit for your animals.",

WIthout knowing the cause my dog was vomiting everyday sometimes twice. Soon after it happened I decided to search the internet to see if anyone else was having this problem. I found many search options which said that their dogs were experiencing the same issue. This is the search results you can read the proof here.[...]I have contacted Amazon and they said they were going to stop selling it which I see they have not. I got a call from Blue Buffalo last night but was unable to take the call. They never called back. I am going to go through the expense of having the food tested. I plead with you to not buy this product or any others they make. Somewhere along the way (maybe when the company went public) things have changed. I will never use their food again",

At first I didn't know what the cause of the stains were so I tried to slowly cut things out of his diet and daily activity. Then I read that certain ingredients in dog food can cause tear stains. Since I couldn't find any other cause, I switched back to Blue. Low and behold, the tear stains are now gone. My Maltese has a pure white coat again.",

I found out better food could help. I bought the Blue Buffalo and never looked back. My dog has not one single seizure since I switched!

That brand became really hard to find locally, and was very expensive online.I switched to Blue expecting great results based on reviews, but he didn't do well. His stomach was upset at first, and I assumed it was due to switching diets. However, he was still having a lot of stomach issues toward the end of the bag. He started throwing up regularly, and his skin and coat were much drier and less shiny. I switched to a totally different brand, and he has been perfectly fine every since. His skin and coat went back to normal, and he hasn't had any of the upset stomach problems he had had with the Blue food.The only \"perk\" to this food over the others I've fed is the price. Generally about $20 cheaper for the same weight. I guess you get what you pay for.",

He seems to hate the texture or maybe the flavor, I'm not sure - from observation, it seems harder to crunch than the other food, and it just falls out of his mouth whenever I coax him to eat one or two before he just avoids it. Having to pick them up is -2 stars. It's that annoying ahhh! If there weren't those bits, I would give it 5 stars and buy it all the time!",

So we immediately took her off her current food and switched everyone over to Blue Buffalo. It has made many wonderful changes to my dogs. Most notably Sunny's yeast overgrowth has become slowly contained. our other dogs seem to have more energy and have all lost some weight. For us, I can say I will never go back again.",

His coat is black and since Blue Buffalo, his coat is really shiny and his dandruff is all but non-existent, even in the cold New England weather.  It took us almost a year to find a good quality food for him that he enjoys.  As long as Blue Buffalo continues with this type of quality, I'll be a customer for a long time to come.",

Within two weeks she was back to her puppy-like self; active, happy, and not shedding.  A few friends have told us she looks thinner, but we have not weighed her yet.  We also add 1/2 cup of green beans to her twice daily 1 1/4 cup feeding.  She seems to be begging less and feeling better.  This dog food gave us back our puppy!",

The taste seems 100% better to the point where he eats it without complaint.The only issue I have with this food is those \"life bits\".  I have 3 dogs which all eat this food exclusively but there is a bit of an issue with them eating the life bits.  I don't know if they are not good tasting or what but I watch my dogs pick up food, eat the kibble and spit out the life bits. It has become a comical response when the wife of I step on one on the floor and curse out the dogs for not eating their life bits.  Aside from that, no issues and I don't mind spending the $$$ to buy this over other brands.",

Like when you get home with a new watch or sunglasses and spend an hour looking at how shiny it is. Every month the bag comes in the mail and its like Christmas for my dog. Oh and getting this in the mail is way better than going to the store every month and lugging home a 30 lb bag.I adopted my dog from the pound and who knows what he was eating in there. He had diarrhea for the first 3 months I had him until I started feeding him Blue. Now I can pick up his poop with a bag instead of having to use a shovel to pick up wet pancakes (you know what I'm talking about). I would give it 5 stars if it was a little cheaper but to be honest the free prime delivery and \"subscribe and save\" from Amazon makes it a pretty sweet deal.",

They blame it on their manufacturer and claim they didn't even know. Manufactured in China and not in Connecticut as they would have you believe. I will never buy another BB product again and you should strongly reconsider purchasing them yourself.

            "review_text": "I changed to Blue Buffalo Life Protection after spending a week at my Mom's farm. I have always been conscientious of the food I get for my dogs, but I had noticed that over the winter their coats had a lot of visible dander and were just overall dull. After the week on Blue Buffalo there were visible improvements to their coats and I decided to purchase a bag of my own when I returned home. While the cost might put some off initially, I can attest as an owner of 3 40+ lb dogs, that due to the high quality of the food you actually feed your dogs less and they get more in the way of nutrients than less expensive brands. Overall, six months on, the dogs' health has improved and I am very satisfied with this product.***Update***I used Blue Buffalo for several months until my dogs all became inexplicably ill - not eating, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, shakes, and general distress. After trip to ER vet (at a great cost with 3 dogs), I was told to put them on a bland diet for 3-5 days and slowly reintroduce their food. The hypothesis from the vet was that they may have gotten into \"something\", but whatever it was, it was not lethal. Followed the prescription diet and then slowly reintroduced Blue Buffalo and WHAM! all three were experiencing the same symptoms as before. Another trip to the ER and the vet suggested it might be the food and to take them off it completely. I did and am happy to say several years later - all of which the dogs have been on Costco's Kirkland brand - we have had zero bouts of intestinal distress. Granted, I may have just gotten a \"bad\" bag, but with my dogs, I am not willing to risk it.",

I read that it could be the ingredients in dog food and that switching to a grain-free dog food with a more uncommon protein and carb could help so I went out to buy the variety pictured but the store was out. Instead I bought a different made in the USA brand and the anal gland problem went away. Just yesterday we ran out of dog food so I returned to the store and purchased the Blue Buffalo fish & sweet potato variety and this morning my dog's anal glands are already impacted and stinky. I'm going to return the food today and switch to a different brand. I don't know if it's an allergy to something Blue uses or what, but impacted glands is not something any of us wants to deal with!",

I have had him on 2 different oral medications and 3 different types of drops plus I have been cleaning his ear daily. Nothing helped.  The vet said our next step would be surgery.  I asked the vet if his ear problem could be related to his food and was told no.  Well I switched to Blue Buffalo 4 weeks ago and his ear has never looked better.  It may be a coincidence, but I am keeping my dogs on the Blue Buffalo,  Plus my dogs love the taste.",

He always ate well, had great energy, coat was soft and shiny, but then he started eating grass several times a day along with throwing up shortly there after.  Long story short we migrated over to Royal Canin Medium breed and since the change he hasn't eaten grass or thrown up since.  We have always gone to Bansfield for our vetenarian and in the beginning they suggested blue buffalo, but there story has changed and now recommend Royal Canin.  Ask your vet on their opinion on blue baffalo.",

            "review_text": "This was absolutely NOT the same product that we buy from the pet store. Our dog loves Blue Buffalo Lamb & Rice and has been eating it since the day we adopted him. We always buy our dog food at Petsmart or Pet Supermarket, with great results. This is the FIRST AND LAST time we will order his dog food from Amazon, or online at all, after such a terrible experience. Soon after starting a new bag of food, our dog began to have diarrhea for several days. Then, he did not poop at all for 2 days. This had coincided with an overnight boarding, so, at the time, we had thought it had something to do with that. We had called the vet who had suggested we try to wait it out, in case it was something foreign he ingested that would work it's way through his system. Were about to take him to the animal hospital because we were so concerned, but then my husband suggested that perhaps it could be the food. I did not want to believe it. Amazon stands by their products as authentic, right? How could it be that?? Well, we purchased a new bag from the pet store and wouldn't you know it -- IT LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. The pieces of food are a different size, shape and color. Not easily noticeable if you aren't looking for it, but now that I have, the difference is clear. I'm completely outraged. I don't know if this product is a knock-off, or if it's old, or outdated, or recalled, or what, but I won't be ordering it from Amazon again, that's for sure. I'll try to upload a photo comparison of the food later.",

No more vomiting and back to her normal self.  I am convinced this food was making my dog sick. We took our other dog to a vet for an unrelated issue and asked about this food. The vet did not recommend feeding blue buffalo. In speaking with other educated sources in the veterinary industry, I haven't come across a single person that would recommend this food. I'll never buy again.I gave it one additional star bc I do know a dog that has just switched to this food without issue. Only time will tell how it works out though.",

At first he took right to it, but once he was served just the Blue Buffalo he refused to it! I had to entice him with people food. I bought a small bag of the Purina One I was feeding him and tried mixing the foods again. My yellow lab then proceeded to pick out the Blue Buffalo food and spit it on the floor and only eat the Purina One. I have never seen my dog turn down any kind of food until now.

As the owner of two small dogs, we had never gotten a really big bag of dog food before.Enter the Blue Buffalo mega bag! We felt like we were dog owners with a Saint Bernard when we opened up the box and saw this giant bag of fishery for the pups. The dogs had really been enjoying Natural Balance dry dog food that was fish and sweet potato flavor, but it was a little too pricey. We switched to Blue Buffalo gradually and the pups love it just as much, if not more!One of our dogs used to eat wet food, but he really loves Blue Buffalo products even more. It's been substantially easier for us and it's been a lot better for his teeth to eat dry dog food. The wet, raw food he had been eating was leading to a lot of tartar build up and we're really happy that we have him on a food that he likes that's good for his teeth. They've tried the Blue Buffalo chicken flavor as well, but I think the fish is where it's at.For our two dogs (9 lbs and 20 lbs), this mega bag will easily last us months! We love Blue Buffalo products!",

They both developed diarrhea and one started having problems controlling her bladder, urinating inside the house. Over the holidays, she refused to eat it at all and lost significant weight. A little internet research found numerous reports of similar symptoms by owners feeding Blue Buffalo. Evidently something changed in the fall of 2014.Luckily, our dogs' refusal to eat probably avoided significant health issues. We switched to Nutro and all of the issues disappeared within a week. Sorry Blue Buffalo, one bad experience is all you get. We will never feed your food to our pets again. Never.",

I usually buy it from Tractor Supply, but this one time I was able to buy it much cheaper from Amazon. However, since this purchase, the only offers online from the sellers on Amazon are quite a bit more expensive than buying it from Tractor Supply, so I won't buy it online again unless this lower price shows up again! That is  the reason for the four stars; the dog food itself is really great; my older dog really does do better on it. Just saying....I have to edit my review to reflect the fact that I was able to reorder this dog food with my Prime subscription and saved ten dollars off the price at Tractor Supply; hopefully I can continue to do so.",

            "review_text": "I've had my puppy for a few months now, and he's been doing quite well on Purina. After visiting my dad over the weekend, he gave me a bag of this stuff because his dog wouldn't touch it. I went online and read the reviews, including a lot of the negative ones. I was skeptical, and held off on it for a little while. Then one afternoon, I was about to feed my dog before heading off to work when I realized we were pretty much out of dog food (I didn't realize earlier because my fiance and I alternate feeding the dog). I figured that there were so many positive reviews, it was most likely a few bizarre cases where dogs got sick, and it may have even been from something else. I gave him a scoop, and left for work. When I got home, all of my concerns were immediately validated. My dog had horrible diarrhea, was throwing up, and was extremely listless and shaking.If you read through the ingredients in this food, most of it really seems fine, but I can promise you that it's not. I don't know if it's due to some kind of product mishandling, or other unlisted ingredients, but there's a reason this stuff has so many bad reviews. I wish I had listened to the negative reviews, despite them being drastically outweighed by the positive ones. A quick Google search will show you some of the horrible things associated with this product - shakes, tremors, seizures, digestion issues, and in several cases death. You know it's a problem when an extremely hungry dog won't touch it. I'm not a dog expert. I've only had my dog for a few months, and I'm still learning a lot. I am by no means a dog food snob, and really only tried this overpriced dog poison because my father tried to do the right thing for his dog and bought him the \"good\" food. There's nothing wrong with the $13 bag of Purina puppy chow at the grocery store. Save your money and your dog's life.",

Every time we went 100% Taste of the Wild, the new dog would get horrendous  diarrhea. So, I went to my local pet store, and asked if they had a dog food with rice and chicken, which is what I was feeding her on before we tried making the switch. They recommended this. Her stool is much better, within days of starting it. It's a shame we can't have both dogs on this food, but it just goes to show, just like humans, no dogs are created equal. Now if this stuff just wasn't so expensive! Even more than Taste of the Wild, which is a grain free dog food.",

It's still a quality dog food... but you won't find me feeding it to me dog since it has Garlic, and she has a ridiculously sensitive digestive system.

First off it took way too long to receive, which is unusual for Amazon and secondly, and more important, it was not of the same quality we normally buy at the local pet store.  We purchased it from Amazon because it saved us a few dollars.  We have been using this particular brand and flavor for over a year as one of our dogs has stomach issues.  However, once we received this bag from Amazon, our dog immediately began having stomach issues all over again (to the point, we thought we'd have to take her into the vet) and both dogs turned up their noses at this food, they would eat it but only because that's what we fed them.  We noticed too that it seemed so much dryer, both the dry bits and the moist bits ... noticeably different.  We checked the expiration date on the bag and all was well.  We do not know WHY this product is so different from the same thing we buy locally but it is.  We purchased it again locally today and our dogs went nuts eating it ... loved it again!!!",

One of my 4 year olds chores (that she actually loves to do) is feeding our dog.  One morning, she fed our dog his name-brand dog food and, mid-munching, our dog turned about and licked our daughter on the cheek.  My daughter immediately broke out in hives.My daughter has lots of food allergies, one of which is peanuts.  Imagine my horror when I looked at our name-brand dog food and realized peanuts were a main ingredient!  I always read food labels to keep my daughter safe, but it never occurred to me that I needed to check the dog's food.  I immediately set about trying to find a dog food that didn't have nuts.  I couldn't find one at our local big-box store.  I got on amazon and found Blue Buffalo!!Blue Buffalo, not only is great for my dog, but it's NUT FREE!  I can let my daughter feed our dog and not worry that she's going to have a severe allergic reaction!  I would buy it just because it's nut-free, but I've been so pleased with the quality of the food and the benefits to our dog as well.  Our dog eats less of this than he did of the name-brand dog food we were buying.  His coat seems shinier.  The *only* disappointment, which really isn't one, is that it didn't \"cure\" my dog's shedding.  (No, we didn't seriously think it would, but there's always wishful thinking.)We happily are repeat customers and this is the only dog food we'd get for our dog!",

He used to have bad skin, and every couple of times each month he would have seizures.Our old vet said this can be common because of his breed and/or it may be because of allergies; we changed to prescription food (rabbit was the main protein) and this did not work. We didnt think it was worth the money when there were no successful results and switched back to Beneful. This was bad in that it gave our dog severe diarrhea,  to the point where he couldn't hold it in and/or blood would squirting everywhere as well. We brought him to the vet many times and they couldn't find what was wrong with him.We researched then and  read online about how Beneful was horrible with dogs and gave them side effects such as dry skin and even seizures and we researched about blue buffalo before we bought it the first time (5 years ago). Since we switched and eased him into Blue Buffalo, he does not have as bad dry skin as before, and he has not had a seizure since (knock on wood)! He loves the food and we switch from flavor to flavor once un a while so he doesn't get bored with it. He has more energy too! We got others to switch to Blue Buffalo and their dogs love it too! It may be expensive but it's definitely worth it for our Cockapoo and we will never be switching to Beneful or any brand similar to them again.",

She was losing a nail down to the quick every other week. A combination of this food and salmon oil worked amazing.

I have one dog with diabetes, so I have to feed her what works well for her, too. She is voracious and will eat anything. I got this food and my two dogs refused to eat it for 3 days. My dog with diabetes ate it and had diarrhea. I've gotten food before that they didn't like, but I put it outside for the homeless animals to eat, too, so it wasn't a complete loss. The next day, they hardly touched it! I usually put out Purina food for all of the homeless animals. Something is seriously wrong with this food that the starving homeless animals won't eat it and my dogs would rather not eat anything at all than eat this. I finally got them eating again by cooking brown rice and getting their regular food, mixed with Beneful wet dog food. I won't speculate what's wrong with it, but I will probably wind up throwing this new bag in the trash. I hate wasting money and food like that, but their health is more important.",

            "review_text": "Word of caution. My dog has been on BB food for 5 years. I've used all types, chicken, lamb, fish. I had recently switched to fish and potato as she had developed a skin allergy to chicken. The fish mix straightened her out. She was on it for three months, until a few days ago, when she had an OD reaction to the vitamin supliment in the food. How do I know? Simple. BB consists of two types of kibble, the triangular meat and vegetable portion and a dark round supplemental nugget portion. The ratio of one to the other is usually something like 95% to 5% meat kibble to supplemental nugget. This bag consisted of more than 60% supplemental nugget. I should have known  better but I trusted BB to not let a bad mix out of the factory. My dog had a toxic reaction - heavy salivating, drooling, discomfort - a few hours after dinner. I returned the bag of fish and potato and picked up a bag of BB lamb and rice. Before walking out of the store I opened the bag and checked the ratio. Looked normal. fed it to dog. No problems. So, bottom line, check the ration of the kibble in the bag before feeding to your dog, and don't trust Blue Buffalo to own up to the problem and initiate a recall.",

He was itchy, had frequent ear infections and even on the low end of the recommended amount of food for weight, he gained weight.  So after reading the reviews, decided to try Blue Buffalo Lamb and Rice about three months ago.  Jakes's skin and coat are much healthier, no longer scratching.  Even at the maximum amount of food for his weight he has slowly lost weight and is at the weight he should be now (lost about 9 lbs).  He has had no ear infections and his ears stay nice and clear!  Jake loves the flavor! The only downshot I have is that the food size is not optimal for a large dog.I like buying from Amazon.  We have a Prime membership so shipping isn't an issue.  It comes to my door, cost is the same as the local big box pet store.",

I noticed it was cheaper on Amazon then in my typical pet store so I ordered 2 bags on what was shown to be eligible for prime. I was out of town and my dog was running low on food anyway so I decided having it shipped to the house for the sitter would be the best option.When I checked out it only offered 3-5 day shipping, I called amazon and the woman apologized saying it was an error on their end, but the woman at customer support assured me I would get the food within 3-5 days (considering my dog was already low to begin with). It is now day 3 and my dog food is still marked as \"not shippoed\" and the estimated delivery date is May 8th - May 27th? WHAT! I called Amazon customer support AGAIN and the story was different! The new woman said the item really \"is not in stock but shows it is in stock because it is shipping from a third party seller that advertises on their website\". After that I ask why the option of 3-5 days as a shipping speed comes up and how nit was still not shipped, while the other person I spoke to 3 days ago told me it would come. The woman then says \"shipping speed and shipping date are different,\" and that \"if you (I) reviewed your (my) order you (I) would see it wasn't going to come.\" Excuse me Amazon for assuming shipping speed was related to shipping, long story short the lady had no remorse that I was over 3,000 miles away and my dog was going to run out of food. I told them to cancel my order since getting the dog food TWO MONTHS FROM NOW was not going to help my dog!!!",

Our neighbor, who's dog is our Aussies play mate, had been encouraging us to switch to Blue.  After reading the packaging, we thought it sounds great, it's more expensive-so it must be better.  1 week later our dog has had non-stop 36 hour diarrhea.  Drinking endless water.  Night and day, non stop.  2 vet trips later, steriod shot, antibiotics, probiotics, warm compresses and neosporin, we are praying for him to recover.  Yesterday we through away the expensive Blue and bought a bag of the Pro Plan. With white rice and his normal scoop, today we saw his stool firming up again.  Our dog does not have a sensative stomach at all.  He has counter surfed as a puppy and ate many many things.  That is not the case here, the Blue Dog food has caused such diarrhea that his rear end is severly inflammed, he walks sideways and runs from his back end.  He drags and sits on his bottom refusing to walk.  DONT DO IT, something in this food will make your dog sit.  Read the consumer affairs report.  Same symptoms with over 500 other dogs.",

            "review_text": "So, like most people who are willing to buy an extremely expensive dog food, I thought this product would help my dog lose some weight and be healthier for her in the long run. She had been eating Purina Dog Chow since she was a year old and I thought it was time for a switch since she is a little heavier than I would like her to be. I bought this product about 1 1/2 weeks ago and weaned her off of the Purina after 1 week. Now that the Blue is the only thing in her bowl, she refuses to eat it. I have been mixing less than a spoonful of canned food to get her to eat it, but she still will not finish it. I have not noticed any gastrointestinal distress as others have had problems with, but honestly, I have not been paying that much attention to her stool. I certainly will be now, though. If she continues on this dog food, she definitely will lose weight, but only because she's not eating it, which of course, is absolutely unacceptable. I have no idea how I'm going to finish this bag of food for this one little dog, but I certainly was disappointed that my dog didn't like it and that it was so expensive. I know that Purina makes a Healthy Weight dog food that, in the case of my parents' dogs, is very palatable and has helped their obese beagle shed over 5 lbs, though in all honesty, his success was due mostly to being on a controlled diet instead of getting fed free-choice or just a \"scoop\" of food whenever he was hungry.",

            "review_text": "A few months ago, Joey who is now 1 ½ yrs old, had crystals in his urine. Assuming that it was because of him being a puppy, his hygiene wasn’t the best. Was put on antibiotics and Hills food for 10 days. The crystals cleared up. Then on Oct 17th of this years, he developed severe diarrhea and was vomiting. I gave him an Imodium and withheld food that night. The Next morning I fed him a small amount of food and within 15 mins. he threw that up too.  We were out of town at the time, so I had to take him to a vet I knew nothing about. Luckily Brewer Vets in Springfield, IL were great. I immediately had them do an xray because this is a dog that was known to swallow rocks and it was the exact same symptoms. Xray showed he had several pockets of gas in his stomach and intestines. All his blood work and vitals were normal. The vet thought that maybe the stress from traveling caused it. Although we were only 2 ½ hrs. from home and Joey had slept the entire way there. Joey stayed at the vets for the day to make sure he did not become more dehydrated, then started him on Flygal and Hills food for 5 days. After a few days of this I put him back on BB. The diarrhea did not clear up and he was vomiting yellow phlegm in the morning about every 1 or 2 days.At the same time that all this started with Joey, Frankie, who is 10 yrs., started drinking water excessively and peeing a lot. Took another stool sample of Joey’s and a urine sample of Frankie’s to my vets about 4 days later. Joey’s stool sample was negative and Frankie’s urine showed a very high PH count. Joey had also started drinking large amounts of water. More lab work done on Joey and also on Frankie. Both came back normal. We thought that maybe Joey had become allergic to chicken, so I bought a bag of BB fish & potato. Another 10 day round of Flygal and Hills food for 3 or 4 days for Joey and antibiotics for Frankie. After 2 weeks, Frankie had crystals in his urine and Joey still had Diarrhea. My vet put Frankie on a different antibiotic and Hills food for 2 weeks. Frankie has always gone to the bathroom 4 to 6 times a day and at least 1 time would be a soft stool. After 2 or 3 days on the Hills food, Frankie stopped drinking as much and going to the bathroom as often, and not one was diarrhea. Kind of made the light bulb go off.  Frankie’s urine sample yesterday still shows his PH is high but the crystals are gone. Started reading all the reviews about Blue Buffalo and was amazed at how many dogs had the same symptoms as Joey and Frankie. Switched all 4 of my dogs to Wellness dog food….no chicken in it either. Within 2 days Joey’s stools were almost normal again. 3 dogs I switched over cold turkey and Joey in 1 ½ days. Not 1 of them even had soft stools from switching so fast.Both Joey and Ranger, 1 of my other dogs kept licking and chewing their butt every time they went to the bathroom. This stopped after switching food too.At the time all this started, both Joey and Ranger were only getting ¾ cup of BB. In the morning they got raw chicken backs and freeze dried raw food. At night they got BB and ¾ cup freeze dried raw. I don’t even want to think what might have happened to Joey if he had eaten only BB. Frankie and Leeah were getting straight BB. Lucky for me Leeah never got sick since she is 12 yrs old and wouldn’t have bounced back as fast as Joey.It’s too bad that Blue Buffalo doesn’t spend some of their money on trying to figure out what’s wrong with their food instead of so much on advertising trying to convince people how good their dog food is. Even better, maybe they could pay my vet bills which, at this point, amount to hundreds of dollars. I had been using BB for almost 2 yrs. and you can bet I’ll NEVER use it again. There are several sites on the web with bad reviews for BB and I’m going to try to post this to as many as I can find.",

It does have a strong fish smell, but like others have said that is to be expected. All three of our dogs really like it and don't hesitate to eat it day after day. It seems to have helped with the itching, but it did something even better - our old cocker mix has urinated in the house on and off for years. We have seen the vet and tried medications that didn't seem to fix the problem. Once she had been on this food for a few months the urinating has stopped. She's been on it for almost two years.",

Quality of life for us: excellent. Quality of Life for Dogs: excellent.  everyone is happy.This was a dog that wouldn't eat any of the dog food's (all brands) we tried over the last four  and a half years (he is 4 years old) the weird thing was the weight gain (chewies and snacks)? Now he is losing weight and his coat is shiny and healthy, and Babe our 10 year old lab is healthy and energetic etc (Babe always ate the food we purchased for Sam) but she really loves Blue.My sister Liz is the one that told us about Blue......thank you Liz and Amazon......",

But worse than than, he began to eat his own feces!  Literally right after he'd produce it.Needless to say I transitioned him back to Pro Plan, which we were not unhappy with anyway.  Both problems stopped.  Bottom-line, I would never recommend this food.",

When I went back into the store to read the ingredients again after years there it was TURKEY and they did not even warn the public if they were going to change the product. I called the company and asked why and they said they just changed the product and said they were sorry.

We have tried numerous brands of dog food, but Dexter turned his nose up and refused to eat more often than not. My husband and I had made a game out of meal time, hand feeding Dexter one piece of food at a time while telling him what a \"good boy\" he was with every bite that he ate! As you can imagine, meal time with Dexter was EXHAUSTING!Thank goodness Petco recommended that we try Blue Buffalo Fish and Sweet Potato Recipe! We were THRILLED when we put Dexter's food bowl down and he immediately dug in! He never came up for air, eating every bite of the Fish and Sweet Potato recipe! We have been feeding Dexter the Fish and Sweet Potato recipe for 6 weeks now and he still loves it! THANK YOU BLUE BUFFALO!",

I can't say if it was his food or not.  The vet recommended I supplement his food with probiotics.  Then price on amazon got higher, I also read that they had changed the recipe and ultimately decided to change food.I saw that they carried a new brand called Hi-Tek that included pre and probiotics which was the same price as the blue buffalo used to be and changed to that.  He loved that, too, (you know, because he is so hard to please..).  He has been on that for a year and he has not gotten sick since. Again, I don't know if that is due to the food but considering the cost and convenience, I am prefer the Hi-Tek brand.  I wish they carried that as a subscribe and save.",

            "review_text": "I tried Blue Buffalo on the recomendation of an agent when I adopted my rescue. I never thought that a premium food would make such a difference though. The ingredients are pretty straight forward and the more I learned about how dog food is made the more amazed I was a BB for how they make their foods. For one I love the fact that I feed about half of what I would feed my dogs using normal dry foods, which makes the bag last twice as long. Also I can tell the difference in their health, they are more active and having a sheltie with a sensitive stomach I was amazed at how dramatic the decrease in incidents related to his digestive problem we had. As a fact, since I switched we have only had 2 this year (mainly because someone didn't follow the no table scraps rule) where with other regular and even higher end foods we had issues once or twice a week even if he did not get anything outside of his regular kibble.",

When she wasn't having diarrhea, she was having a very loose stool and pooping a lot when she went on her walks. I thought I was because we bought her the healthy request, so I decided to try the \n\nBlue Buffalo Dry Dog Food, Lamb and Rice Recipe, 30-Pound Bag\n\n  .That didn't help matters at all. After she had an accident in our kitchen, I decided to do research. I thought maybe she had a bug or something, since we did just get her from the pound a little over two weeks prior. Why would a dog food that was supposed to be the best be the culprit?Apparently, Blue Buffalo is a rich food that isn't tolerated by all dogs due to it being high in protein (regardless of flavor). By typing in \"Blue Buffalo Loose Stool\" on Google, I got loads of hits from concerned dog owners of different breeds having the exact same issue.I switched our girl to Purina One Smartblend, and she loves it...and no more stinky, loose poop!",

            "review_text": "I switched my dogs from chicken soup for the pet lovers soul to blue buffalo and immediately my dogs and my cat started shedding so bad that I had furballs rolling around my house like tumbleweed! I kept them on it to see if it was just an initial reaction to the food change only to find that they started itching like they had fleas and had so much dander they looked like they had rolled in powder. I then read the ingredient panel to find the second ingredient in blue is chicken meal... Chicken meal could be anything! So after much reading of ingredient panels the one food I have always known to be five star was Merrick and they love their wet food so I switched them to Grammys pot pie dry food and viola! Instant change! In less than three days my dogs dander has gone away, their coats are shiny and beautiful again and the tumbleweeds of hair have stopped. I think that with all the advertising by blue they just have their name out there more but really it isn't much better than a grocery store dog food, I mean really chicken meal?! When it claims to be so much better then other foods I expect it to make them look beautiful not dusty and shedding like crazy. I only write this so that people can know that it all depends on the dog and that sometimes the less flashy things are better. Merrick dog foods have never let me down and I shall not be switching unless something changes. Oh also I noticed that Blue had a voluntary recall of their dry dog foods due to too much vitamin D, it's on their website all the details so check your bags sell by dates to the ones listed. Hope this was helpful!",

            "review_text": "After doing some research, and having a general feeling that I needed to get our beloved Shih Tzu off of a store bought brand that touts itself as being for \"Pedigree\" dogs in their small crunchy bits formula, I wanted to switch her to something of high quality.One of the things that started to steer me towards a new quality dog food was the content and lack of consistency of our beloved fur baby's little poos.  They were always very dry, pebbly, crunchy and small.  Sometimes she would go multiple times when out walking in one day just to empty out her \"system\".  Sometimes she would go 2-3 days without pooing a nugget.  When she would go, it looked like she was having to put a monumental effort into it, with straining, grunting, eyes bugging out, etc.  Since this had been the norm all her life, and she certainly was never in a state of dehydration, we finally asked our vet what the deal was, and she pointed at the food.Enter Blue Buffalo.  After a very, very slow and successful acclimation process, things got much better (you really must do this over 6-weeks).  We never had any of the issues some folks in other reviews of mentioned of overly runny poo, diarrhea, etc.  What we did notice was that her poo became very consistent, regular, and she now poos something the size of a BUFFALO patty.  O.o  They are huge, a bit moist, tender and very fragrant now!  The straining and grunting is gone.  When she goes now, they just shoot out of her like a well oiled, long rocket exiting a missile silo.  You can also smell it from 20' away on an upwind breeze.  Just how you'd expect a fresh mound to be.  We are still shocked that something of that size could even emanate from a 12lb precious.We were a bit surprised at the size of the food itself.  We started with the small breed sized food and it was way to small.  The normal sized food was more on order of being comparable to the old food.  To give a comparison, the small breed size is about pea sized.  The regular is more like the size of irregular shaped, small marbles.  She liked the normal size much better, as she could actually feel like she had something to chew on, which is better for her teeth anyway.We have also noticed a significant improvement in her coat and skin.  She has long suffered from hot spots and dry skin patches that she would sometimes incessantly chew on.  We used to have to give her a medication from the vet (a form of steroid) to cool her skin at times during the summer to keep her from chewing herself raw in certain areas.  This has all disappeared!In summary, the food is great stuff, and has worked several wonders on our beloved Shih Tzu.  Hope it does the same for your fur babys!",

Have been forced to go to the local pet store and they didn't have the 15 lb either. Got stuck with the smaller bag and paid as much for it as I have paid for the 15 lb with Amazon",

            "review_text": "My father adopted a dog a year and a half ago to train for search and rescue work.  My dad considered diet to be an integral part of keeping the dog's mind and body finely tuned for search and rescue work so he conducted a few trial months of various dog foods, monitoring changes in energy level, coat health, bowel movements, and general interest in taste.  Blue Buffalo performed the best.  My dad's dogs coat is now extremely plush with no dry flakiness he had when he was first adopted, at a very healthy weight with tons of energy, has had no illnesses whatsoever, and happens to thoroughly enjoy his meals.I adopted a dog for myself about 5 months ago.  The previous owner warned me of his having an sensitive and irritable stomach (prone to diarrhea and bloating) and being picky about foods. Because of that, they'd had him on some ridiculously expensive prescription foods.  He wasn't at a healthy weight and had dry itchy skin with excess shedding, and was a little lethargic.  I immediately switched him over to Blue Buffalo when I got him home, since it worked so well for my dad.  His skin has since totally recovered.  He hasn't had any bowel problems, even when I give him the occasional table scrap. He's now has a very sleek athletic body. And I get compliments all the time about how glossy and beautiful his coat is.  I swear by Blue Buffalo to keep my furry friend healthy, comfortable, and happy.Also, even though it's more expensive upfront than some other main brands, the food is so nutritious that he doesn't need to eat as much of it as he does the others, and it actually saves me money in the long term.",

They always act like I'm torturing them.  So I would end up feeding them Purina Pro Plan and feeling bad about life.  One day, my husband accidentally purchased a bag of Purina One and then they insisted that was the only food for them.  They decided to bunch Pro Plan in with the health foods and boycott it.One of my dogs is pretty skinny with a very high metabolism, so I can't afford him showing ribs and convincing people I'm not feeding him.  So for a while I gave in, and just mixed a high quality food in with the Purina One and let them pick out the pieces.Anyways, I decided to try Blue Buffalo because I was almost out of food and my car was acting funny and there it was on Amazon Prime... HOLY HELL they love this food!  They just eat it right up, no complaints, no looking back at me expectantly.  They enjoy it even more than they enjoyed their garbage food, and I don't have to feel bad about what I'm feeding them!The ingredients are great, the caloric content is good and pretty dense for my skinny boy, and the kibble size is good for my three sized dogs (XL, Medium, and Small but Fat).I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors and perhaps trying a higher quality Blue Buffalo food, but for now I'm just glad they're eating something decent for once!",

She has always had tons of energy, trim build, and shiny fur, but since we've switched her to Blue Buffalo the change has been pretty astonishing.  Her hair is so shiny black that in this springtime sun she looks like she's glistening.  Even from switching a dog from a horrible dog food to something like purina pro plan I haven't seen this much of a change.  I highly recommend this brand.I got her Lamb and Rice, which she loves.  With the old dog food she would eat it, but you could tell she didn't really like it all that much.  She comes running when I fill the bowl up now.  She's silly and she picks the little \"vitabits\" or whatever they're called out but will eat them when I put them back in the bowl?I do recommend switching a dog slowly to this if you're coming from a lower quality dog food.  It can be hard on their stomachs...if you've ever switched to a very healthy diet very quickly you can probably relate.",

            "review_text": "After slowly transitioning to this food over the period of a week, I did notice some looser stools just as many other people reviewing this product.  Towards the end of this transition time the stools became normal and it is a dogfood that he loves to eat.  I can't say that the \"lifebits\" that are in the mix is his favorite thing to eat, but most of the time his bowl is clean.  If he leaves anything in his bowl, it would be a few (2-3) of those which is a very small percentage of what was in the bowl to begin with.My dog IS a PICKY eater and with other brands I have often had to add a small treat to his bowl in order for him to eat it all, but I do not have that issue with this brand.  The one thing that I have done is to add some warm water to the bits which makes them softer as well as release the aroma and flavor.  My dog reacts the same way as he would have if I put some gravy on top of his food when I do that.He has gone from walking up to his bowl and looking at me wondering where his \"treat\" is so that he can eat to jumping up on his hind legs, bouncing around excited that he is about to be fed.The only downside I can think of with this product is that just like some other posters pointed out, there was evidence of some loose stool during transition and that the lifebits does not seem to be something that he enjoys eating.",

Otherwise, she would chew until she had raw wounds. We took her to the vet and they suggested she may have food allergies. They wanted us to try a pricey kind of Science Diet, but said that we could also start with a lamb and rice formula. The Science Diet was expensive and had of a lot of unnatural ingredients, so we decided to try this dog food instead. It has been great for her. As soon as it arrived she was sniffing excitedly at the bag. We put her on this food immediately because we wanted the itching to stop. I think as a result she vomited a few times in the beginning due to the abrupt change. She also had gas. Now she is nearly through the bag of food and those issues have all but disappeared. Her hair has grown back and her coat is shiny and healthy. No more incessant chewing and no more raw spots!",

I have since change to the Taste of the Wild which he actually love to eat (it smells pretty good too) and his stools are improving.

Our GSD has a food senitivity to many commercial foods which was narrowed down to the fillers and other junk found in many dog foods, even \"premium\" brands.  Our astute vet recommended a food with high quality meat protein and a novel carbohyrate source such as sweet potato or rice, but one only.  After several foods, (all \"premium\", at least in price) we tried Blue Buffalo.  Problems disappeared in a snap.  She competes in working trials and Schutzhund work and has more energy and vitality; coat looks shiny and great.  She's been on this food now for 2 years and has done fantastic, both dogs love the taste.  I'm not a holistic tree-hugger, but this is a top quality product--ingredients are nothing you couldn't feed a person.  Read the ingredients on the food you feed; corn is garbage in dog food and a filler only, it is poorly digested by dogs and has zero nutitional value in a canine.  So many companies also use \"meat by-products\" which can mean anything from feathers, beaks, hooves and other scraps to outright rendered road kill, diseased and euthanized animals--I've actually called a couple of other companies to inquire about what exact forms of \"meat\" they use, and ALL refused to elaborate.  This food really is not much different in price than many other \"high end\" dog foods and is clearly a healthier choice for your best friend.  And no, I do not work for Blue Buffalo.",

Also they were shedding more than normal.  I switched to this food, about 4 months ago, and they are doing so much better.  Our dogs are not picky eaters, so I am not sure if all dogs would love it, but they do! We will continue to feed them this brand.",

I gradually changed their food at the same time and the skinnier dog's stomach started rumbling and it just plain didn't agree with him.  My thought was maybe the fiber content was too difficult for him to handle.  I switched him back to the regular Blue Buffalo Chicken dog food and he has been fine.  The heavier dog has been on this for over a year and has had no problems.  His weight gain has stopped and he's even lost a couple of pounds.  Make sure you gradually change your dog's food to this as an abrupt change will most likely give your dog problems.",

She had loose stool for a week after I gave her this bag of food since we ran out of last one. And then she kept having pretty bad stomach. I finally decided to cook her food myself--rice with chicken or beef with vegetable. She loved it!! And her stool was normal. A week later I tried to switch to the Blue Baffalo again, no way! Bad stomach again. So I threw away the Blue Baffalo dry dog food and decided to move on to different brand name. I assumed this time the dry food was rancid or got contaminated because my dog had same food before and she was ok.",

            "review_text": "We have a 9 1/2 year old English Bulldog with bad skin allergies. He was diagnosed at 1 year old and the vet put him on a prescription fish and sweet potato food to rule out a food allergy. It wasn't a food allergy so I went back to his regular food because of the price difference. We've had him on allergy shots ever since which successfully controlled them until we moved from NY to MN 2 years ago. The poor dog has gone through hell ever since. We even had him retested for \"MN\" allergens and he's been on the shots for a year with no improvement. As a last resort I reverted to our old vet's advice and put him on this to check for a food allergy. We were told symptoms would clear up within 2 weeks if it were a food allergy.Unfortunately it didn't clear up his skin, however his digestive health has been the best it's ever been. His old food made him really gassy and he burped a lot and while he was regular, he only went once a day. He's been on this new food for over 2 months and not only is he hardly gassy at all (the occasional burp), but he poops twice a day and they're healthy poops...not too soft or hard. Even though it's more expensive and didn't solve the skin issues, we'll keep him on a BB food for the rest of his life because we like that it's so healthy for him and he's got to be feeling better since he's not so bloated!We are, however, currently in the process of switching him over to the senior chicken and rice formula. I know senior dogs have different dietary needs than adult dogs so I want to make sure he's getting the right amount of stuff he needs and not too much of things he shouldn't be getting a lot of at his age and activity level.If the BB Lamb and Rice performs just as well as the fish and sweet potato then we're set.",

I spread the bottom of the bowl about 2 layers deep with food and that is more than enough for her until her next meal.  The Bag lasts me about 1.5 months before i have to re-up.

They have dropped the weight they were packing on, back into prime shape. I cannot say for certain their coats are so much nicer but I do feel confident in the food being better for them. Cockers have a lot of health issues. I figure this is an investment, a money saver in the long run to feed them right than treat the problems with the lesser foods.",

I have tried other brands with him and while he eats them, it's not with the same relish that he eats the Blue Buffalo.  I also like knowing that the ingredients are healthier for him than Science Diet or Purina.  He is 3 years old and I want him to have a long healthy life, and I believe that with a diet of Blue Buffalo, he will.",

However, shortly after I transitioned him to this food he developed pretty severe stomach problems.  He had terrible diarrhea and would lie around crying.  When we stopped feeding him this, his tummy problems disappeared like magic.  I thought maybe it was a coincidence so we tried again a few months later and exactly the same thing again.  Therefore I can't recommend this dog food.",

            "review_text": "First of all, the \"gain control\" formula is a true joke and has a very deceiving label!!!! One of my dogs gained more than 20 pounds in less than 6 months!!!!!! After 6 months, he could no longer hold the food down as he started vomiting the food and have watery diarrhea 4 to 5 times a day and he would start shaking because he could not hold the food in.  We were so concerned that we took him right away to the vet and vet requested us to change his diet immediately.  We did and his diarrhea stopped right away.  Prior to giving him this food, he was healthy and then coincidentally, he started to have major health problems.To all the people who left comments on my review and think the dry food especially from Buffalo or any other commercial dog food is good and with so much nutrients, then eat it yourself, and see how it works for you ;) I'm sure you'll end up in the hospital. Current pet food regulations allow manufacturers to use ingredients that you would never knowingly give to your pet. In fact, you may be SHOCKED to learn what some companies are putting in their pet food! Take a look  at the video for further info: What's REALLY In Your Pet's FOOD??[...]Furthermore, we got him a companion dog in excellent health condition who was used to eating mainly dry food and we gave her some of this food and to determine whether this food just had an impact (or negative allergic reaction) on our first dog and whether she would be affected or not.  Sure enough, same first day she ate her first bowl of this Buffalo brand food, she had diarrhea and she even woke us up at 2am the first night because she could not hold it anymore. She had diarrhea 6 times in just 24 hours.  A side note on this dog, she has a strong stomach because prior to adopting her, the previous owners told us she eats just about anything from fruits, vegetables, different dry foods and her stomach does not get upset.After all this nightmare and realizing there is no quality at this Buffalo corporation,  we now have started to give them real organic food made by us since we could no longer trust these dog food companies and our older dog has immediately lost the weight he gained thanks to that disgusting, toxic and cheap food. If you have ever watch the movie \"Food Inc\" and have realized what food is available for human beings, just imagine what type of food these dog food Corporations are selling to our dogs (babies)!Now meal time with our home made food is their favorite time of the day, they absolutely love it and start jumping up and down something that never happened with any type of dry food.  Today to our surprise, we found out that THIS PRODUCT IS BEING RECALL FOR CONTAINING TOXIC INGREDIENTS. We are shocked that by giving them this Buffalo food, we were putting in great danger the lives of our beloved dogs.  If you really love your dog and he/she is truly part of your family, make him/her their own food to protect their health and life. Is really easy to make and does not take that much time.  There are books in Amazon that guides you through the food dogs should and should not eat. Now our dogs eat real chicken, brown rice, veggies, and a spoon of organic multi-vitamin which we mix it all together when serving.  This will not only make them happier, healthier, stronger, but also increase their lifespan.The info below will show you some of the reality and suffering of those who have fed their dogs with Buffalo food:truthaboutpetfood com /articles/more-worrisome-news-on-blue-buffalo-dog-food.html",

Prior to Blue Buffalo, our dogs usually got Pedigree or a store brand that might be on sale at the time. We have really noticed a difference in their coats & energy levels since making the switch.  Their fur is so shiny and they don't just lay around all of the time as they did before.  They don't seem to eat as much of the Blue Buffalo either as I guess that it keeps them fuller longer.Our black lab has some skin issues and many foods make her itch like crazy.  We did try the Chicken & Rice Recipe of Blue Buffalo and it irritated her as well so now we stick to the Lamb and Rice Recipe.  At any rate, if you are considering making the switch I would definitely recommend Blue Buffalo.",

He does eat anything he can find, like an old clif bar that he found on the side of the trail or a croissant that he grabbed out of the front seat of some guys car at the trail head, but grass was unusual. So I started researching the food I was feeding him, which was Science Diet active, and it is kind of a junky dog food. After hemming and hawing over what to feed him I decided to go with Blue Buffalo. It isn't off the Richter scale expensive, about 10 bucks more than the science diet, and the ingredient list is pretty good. It has changed his coat which is beautiful and soft, but he hasn't stopped munching on grass and he has insane gas thus the 4 stars. I am purchasing a second bag and we will see how it goes, but I am not too worried because he hasn't has diarrhea and has regular movements which is good for a neurotic dog.",

We have tried other brands (Evo, Nutro, etc...) and Blue Buffalo is by far the best.  Our lab gets ear infections from any other type of food and our mutt is a picky eater. Both of them scarf this down with no problems! We also have switched our cat onto Blue Buffalo, and he loves it. HIGHLY recommended, worth the extra money and is it of good quality and you actually end up feeding you pet less of this food than others.",

My lab and dachshunds did just fine, and I could really tell the differences in their coat and they are so much more energetic. But my Great Dane, although loved the food, wouldn't stop having soft stools and I think her shedding got worse. We allowed 3 bags ... so about a month plus/minus a week or so to make sure the new food settle in, but her stomach really didn't like it so we switched the brand. I gave it 4 stars even though we switch because my lab and two weiners didn't have any problem and they liked it just fine. Wilderness is much more expensive, I think, but now all my dogs look and behave even better. It has more nutritious, and it's a different premium level than this one. So ... if you can afford it, try that one. But this is still 1000 times better than craps like Iams and Kibble n' Bits!!!!04/27/2012 UPDATESo we completely switched to Eukanuba since then. We tried all the Blue products that was available -- nothing worked for my Dane. Her stomach isn't liking anything from Blue. So far Eukanuba is the only thing keeping her from diarrhea. It got so bad that I think our vet bill run up to almost $500. Not cool :(",

            "review_text": "Growing up, my family always gave our dogs good quality foods like Nutro, so I wanted to make sure my own pets ate well.  I'm on a tight post-college budget, but Blue Buffalo is totally worth it.  My 35 lb corgi mix gets 2/3 cup twice a day (plus whatever falls on the kitchen floor), and a 30 lb bag of Blue Buffalo lasts us 2 1/2 to 3 months.  My dog's coat is beautiful, her stools are normal, her weight is healthy and doesn't fluctuate.  She's a very happy dog, and when I think about how I'm feeding her for $20 a month, I'm a happy owner.We originally had her on the chicken and rice flavor for the first year or so, but when Amazon stopped carrying it we switched to the lamb and rice.  My dog seems to like the lamb even more (though to be fair, she's a corgi mix and will eat anything).  I've also noticed she has significantly less eye boogers than she did on the chicken flavor.  I was wiping substantial boogers off her eyes once or twice a day before, and now I clean just dried stuff off her face maybe twice a week.  She doesn't have any health conditions, so I guess there may have been an allergen in the chicken flavor that's not in the lamb.",

Our 2 girls like it okay, it has unique life source bits that make the vitamins very available to the system, high quality ingredients which  means they will have better immune systems to fight off diseases, yada yada.  Of course, I want them to live long and healthy lives.  They are our best friends.  I am always on the lookout for a food that is \"better\" and I try samples of many and yet come back to the tried and true.Anyway, on with the review.  The girls were on this food for less than a month and I have to say they really enjoyed eating it. My biggest complaint of this food was in the potty dept. with soft, sometimes runny movements that didn't get better with time.  Now, I could have added things like pumpkin or bran to firm things up but I feel at Blue Buffalo prices I should not be adding a thing.  Also, it seemed coat quality went down as well.I do like the Blue Buffalo concept and may sometime in the future try a different formula in their line up or wait and see if they decide to 'fine tune' the Chicken and Rice a little more to be more agreeable.",

            "review_text": "I switched to Blue Buffalo on a recommendation from my mother who has had bulldogs for years.  I had been using Iams Weight Control for my two Cocker Spaniels.  I gradually transitioned from the Iams to BB.  As the transition progressed, my dogs appeared to be more hungry at each feeding.  As it turned out, I think that they were just starting to enjoy their food for the first time in their short little lives. Sad, really.  But how can a person tell if a dog food actually tastes good?  If I were to pick a dog food based on what I THINK might taste good, I would be feeding my dogs Beneful dog food (their commercials make ME hungry).  In any case, they seem to love BB.  So that's the review from the dog's point of view.As for how this change in dog food has impacted MY life.  I live on a half acre and my two cockers can really spread wealth, if you know what I mean.  I really like to keep the lawn \"bomb free\" so my kids and I pick-up the lawn often.  When the dogs were eating Iams, the \"surprises\" that they would create would lay softly beneath the top blades of grass, just waiting for someone to come step on them.  It was too often an ugly situation that I will not describe here.  Since we have been feeding the dogs BB, those \"duce-balls\" now sit lightly upon the TOP of the grass.  They are light, easy to see and very firm (Eauwwwww!) As a result, pick-up is quicker and the lawn is cleaner.I suggest you give this food a try, but be cautious.  Based on some reviews, BB has had some quality problems in the past.  Nobody wants to lose their animal due to negligence on the part of a dog food company.  As with any change in your dog's diet, monitor closely.  Even if a food is safe and healthy, not all foods agree with all animals.  So remember, be cautious, we all want the best for man's best friend.",

We tried different shampoos, lotions, steroid shots - anything to give her some relief.My wife suggested she might have an allergy to the carbohydrates/gluten in her food that got worse in the south Texas heat.  We ordered a bag of the Blue Buffalo dry dog food and after the first feeding, she laid down next to us and did not scratch one time all evening.  Her fur has grown back and she no longer has the patches of nasty, smelly rash on her.  She now has energy to run up the stairs, run around in the yard and acts like she did as a puppy.  The change in less than a week is amazing!We have ordered more Blue Buffalo for all 6 of our dogs and our cat. Their coats are shinier and their eyes sparkle more.

My other two dogs are a little pickier. Rocky ate a few bites of this pretty good but he refused to eat it the second time I fed it, Buddy who is my pickiest eater won't touch this dog food at all.The ingredients of this Blue dog food are excellent and I wish that all my dogs would eat it. Buddy seems to prefer Purina Dog Chow, Eukanuba Naturally Wild Turkey and the Science Diet Active Longevity dry food the best of any.So, even though, I know this is good quality dog food I won't repurchase (at least this flavor) I want to find a flavor that all 3 of my dogs will eat.NOTE: I noticed the main ingredient in this is White fish... I've never had a cat who'd actually liked any food with White fish in it maybe my dogs are the same. That probably accounts for the strong smell of this dog food.",

            "review_text": "Note: Blue Buffalo no longer makes \"Weight Control\" dog food and instead makes \"Healthy Weight\" dog food in the \"Life Protection line.  Healthy Weight has 415 calories per cup and 3.290 calories/gram.  Compared to the Longevity line for adult dogs, Healthy Weight has more calories per cup but a fewer calories per gram, meaning that Healthy Weight has more grams per cup than Longevity. Looking at the order of ingredients (which is by pre-production ingredient weight), I am concerned that too much of Healthy Weight's protein may come from whole grains, which do not contain all of the amino acids that a dog must get from his or her food (dogs cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from plants and grains the way humans can.) De-boned chicken is the first ingredient, but, because it contains 75% water before processing, it is not the heaviest final ingredient.  Chicken meal is a high quality protein, but it is listed as the fifth ingredient.Also: At the bottom of this review I name a brand of food that ultimately helped me meet my dog's goals.Overview of Weight Control: While I did not do all I could to make Weight Control work for my dog, it ultimately did not help my dog reach his ideal weight. Blue Weight Control is nutrient rich, very low in fat, and uses high-quality protein sources. Unfortunately, Blue Weight Control has 444 calories per cup, which  is pretty calorie-dense.  I believe it was over 4 calories per gram, which, in human food, is the caloric density of cheddar cheese.  My dog may have been able to eat a satisfying quantity of this food if he only needed to maintain a healthy weight, but he needed to lose weight, and the portions I had to feed him were too small. Fortunately, Blue Buffalo makes an excellent food called \n\nBlue Buffalo Longevity Dry Food for Adult Dogs, 24-Pound Bag\n\n  , and the adult food has a more reasonable 354 calories per cup, allowing my dog to eat a more satisfying quantity of food per day.Details: My dog weighed 50 lbs. and needed to get to the maximum ideal weight for his breed --44 lbs.-- as determined by my vet and the American Kennel Club.  According to several dog nutritionists, the calories a dog should consume per day to lose weight is computed as follows:  1)Convert his goal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2.2.  For my dog 44 lbs over 2.2= 20.  2  Multiply her weight in KG by 30.  For my dog 20*30 is 600. (3)Add 70. In my dog's case, that meant 670 calories per day.  This number represents the dog's caloric needs while on a weight loss diet, assuming the dog has no special needs, such as pregnant or whelping, being a puppy, being a toy breed, working, or living outdoors in cold weather. The formula only is valid if the dog weighs between 5 and 99 pounds. Check with your vet to make sure the daily calories you compute are in the right neighborhood.The reason Blue Weight Control was not the best Blue Buffalo food for my dog was because it is is relatively calorie dense-- 444 calories per cup. To feed him 670 total calories per day, I could only feed him 1.5 cups per day, meaning that each of his two meals could only be 3/4 cups, and that was without even a tiny buffer for a single green bean as a treat. (Later I explain why I had to add-in other foods.  I ended up only feeding him 2/3 of a cup for each meal, and that really worried me about the adequacy of his nutrition. This quantity of food is well below the feeding guidelines on the bag. My dog was miserable and begged constantly. He would even lick his empty bowl between meals.  I tried feeding him a 1/3 cup (10 calories) of plain no-added-salt canned green beans as a snack, just to help fill his stomach, but he was not content and eventually turned his nose up at the green bean snacks.  I should have added warm water to his dog food and stirred in the green beans, but I wasn't smart enough to do so at the time. My dog kept acting hungry and begging for more dog food.  He would actually walk over to the bag of dog food, put his paw on it, and look at me while whining softly! Other members of my household would sneak table food to him because he begged so persistently, and the \"diet\" was a abysmal failure.  My poor dog ended up actually gaining 4 more pounds from all the human cheating!I was glad I found Blue Longevity adult food.  It has 354 calories per cup as opposed to 444. It has 3.384 calories/gram.  I gave my dog 1.8 cups per day (in 2 meals) for 640 calories. A saleswomen at Petsmart explained that I could help increase my dog's feeling of fullness even more by adding warm water to to his food, enough to just cover the kibble, and letting it sit on the counter a minute so that the kibble would swell up. I should then stir in 10 calories (a little less than 1/4 cup) of no-added-salt green beans to make it an even more filling meal. I did all of these changes together, so I can't separate the effects. My dog stopped the whining and began to lose the weight.I budgeted him only 10 calories per day for treats. The problem was, I had to find something to give as a treat at least 3 times per day.  See, my dog lived in a no-kill shelter for 18 month, so I had to use treats to re-housebreak him. Now he refuses to do #2 unless he is guaranteed a treat (if he doesn't get one immediately after he goes, he lies down on the ground and makes us carry him home--even if we are two blocks from the house and it is dark and pooring down rain. Welcome to my world of loving an Australian Cattle Dog.) I was surprised to learn that small sized Milk Bones have 20 calories each and contributed to him getting overweight to begin with. Even breaking one in half wasn't enough to make his treat calories reasonable. I found a bite-sized treat that is only 1-2 calories called \n\nPremier Liver Biscoti Dog Treats, Original Recipe, Original Bite Size, 8oz. Bag\n\n  ).  They were fine as a substitute for Milk Bones. I recently found a 2-calorie  treat that my dog is crazy about called \n\nZuke's Mini Naturals Salmon Dog Treats\n\n   (not to be confused with the 10-calorie each \n\nZuke's Mini Bakes Chicken N Cherryz, 16 oz\n\n  . My dog would probably walk through fire for the Salmon flavored ones, but he also likes the peanut butter flavored ones.Update: I eventually found a web site called DogFoodAdvisor.com.  Through it, I found another food called \n\nPremium Edge Healthy Weight I Weight Reduction Formula Adult Dry Dog Food, 35-Pound\n\n   that has the same calories per cup as Longevity but that has twice as much protein (also from high quality sources!) It is also grain-free (dogs don't need grains in their diet at all) and a little less expensive per pound.  It helped my dog build muscle and lose weight.",

He LOVES the taste of it too if gobbling it up as soon as it hits the bowl is any sign. He is usually not the type of dog that eats RIGHT AWAY. We've tried to keep him on a schedule so he doesn't just eat whenever he feels like it. It's been tough, but this food has helped to encourage him to eat his food when it's set out.

My American bulldog mix was getting overweight and i wanted to help her shed a few pounds using this food since the TOTW is pretty high in fat.  The countless positive reviews on petsmart and mostly good on amazon had me sold. I really wish i had tried a different food now. I noticed both dogs stool was a little soft when i was gradually changing them over. Which i didn't think much of. Once i completely switched them over, it was probably the first night i was awoken to one of my dogs having terrible diarrhea on my carpet. (which is a lovely aroma to wake up to) She also threw up a couple times that day and the next as well. So i took her to the vet and everything was normal, the vet gave her some meds just in case it was a stomach bug. The next day my Shepherd starting having the same terrible diarrhea and went in the house. The food is the only thing that has changed with my dogs so i really have no doubt it is what has caused all of the problems. I'm going to discontinue using this food immediately and probably go back to the TOTW. I would use this food with caution!",

I am very happy with both the quality ingredients in Blue and that I can also buy it in cat food for my two cats. My cats (which were strays) were diagnosed two years ago with Feline Immune Virus (cat equivalent of HIV), but have stayed healthy with no symptons. I attribute this, in part, to their diet. The dogs' coats are shiny and they have lots of energy. Both my dogs and cats love Blue. In fact, one of my cats, even when his Blue cat food is sitting right there, will sometimes try to eat the dog food. This says a lot about Blue's ingredients because very few cats will choose to eat dry dog food.Mostly, I buy the chicken and rice but I switch flavors sometimes. My animals like all the flavors and I have not noticed any strong odors--just normal food odors--that others have mentioned. I am also fortunate that my pets don't refuse to eat the black kibbles. Dry pet food containing meat has to be processed at high heat for safety, but heat destroys enzymes and many nutrients. The black kibbles are the ones that contain Omega 3 oils for a healthy heart and other special nutrients. Blue makes them with a special cold process so as not to destroy the probiotics. If the animals don't eat the black kibbles it is like they are not eating their vitamins. The black kibbles are what sets Blue apart from any other dry dog food that I am aware of--even the ones with similar high quality ingredients.",

            "review_text": "I read a lot about this food prior to making my purchase. My dog recently suffered from life-threatening bloat...amazingly she survived :) To reduce the chances of future bloat I am now feeding her 4-5 times a day instead of only once. After researching, I found that a food high in protein and low in carbs/corn type grains was healthier and possibly less likely to cause bloat (there is very little known as to the causes of bloat so most information is just theoretical...no definitive findings). Well, I was happy to find that Blue Buffalo foods seemed to be tailored to exactly what I was in search of! In addition, my dog suffers from allergies and I had been supplementing her with Alaskan Salmon Oil for added Omega-3 and Omega-6. After reading about the Blue Buffalo Fish & Sweet Potato food I saw that it offered the additional Omega's and that if she was to eat it I would no longer need to do the separate supplement. Everything sounded wonderful! I placed my order and it arrived promptly. I tried getting her to eat the food for about a week or two before I decided it was a no go :( I tried mixing it with hot water for gravy...still, she never did take to it. She is typically a very accepting dog when new foods are introduced...however, with this food she was not. I wasn't bothered by the smell as were some other reviewers, but I'm not surprised by that since I had become accustomed to the salmon oil smell already. All in all, I do wish she had taken to the Blue Buffalo brand foods as I really like the approach they take with the ingredients and preparation methods. I tried her on the Lamb flavor too but she refused that as well. Although my experience with Blue Buffalo brand turned out to be one that wouldn't work, I would still recommend giving it a try for your pampered pup. It is a great food! Great ingredients! And made in the U.S.A. which is a definite plus! If you have the same problem that I did, the company offers a 30-day money guarantee through whatever retailer you buy from...IT'S WORTH A TRY FOR SURE!!! If you visit their website and fill in a short form they will snail-mail you a $5.00 off any size bag coupon :)",

We're careful to never let her into the garbage or anything toxic and we never feed her any human food, so we took her into the vet with the suspicion that maybe she had lodged something in her system from being outside on the lawn.The vet said she checked out fine, so we were clueless. A friend mentioned that his dog had similar symptoms before he changed her food. We thought there was no way a dog's food could cause such dramatic symptoms in a dog, and our dog was far from a picky eater, so we were a bit weary about the advice but we gave it a shot anyway since our dog was miserable. He recommended Blue Buffalo for its more natural ingredients, so that's the route we took.It has been over six months now and we haven't looked back. Phasing the new food in slowly, she stopped vomiting within days, and had considerably perked up within a week. Some days she has so much energy that it even surprises us. The only thing we did was change her food. Our educated guess was that she was having an allergic reaction to one or more of the synthetic ingredients in the Iams that we were feeding her.To us, the extra price paid to get Blue Buffalo is well worth it to feed our dog a more healthy food.",

            "review_text": "About twoyears ago, I switched my now seven-year-old Doberman from Nutro Natural Choice Dry Dog Food (I posted a review of that product prior to the FDA recall in April 2009) to this product due to the rash of pet illnesses and deaths in the US and Canada linked to Nutro's canned food. (This made national news. In case you aren't familiar with the story, I'm sure the news reports are archived online.) I didn't feel comfortable taking chances with the most helpless member of my family. Luckily, she switched to Blue Buffalo with minimal fuss. I've purchased the Chicken and Rice as well as the Lamb and Rice versions of the product and she loves both equally. However, she will not eat the versions (canned or dry) that contain a major amount of sweet potato, but she is a rather picky puppy. There is (for her) one small drawback with this food; she tends to eat around the \"Lifesource bits\" initially. Eventually though, she does come back to them.The most important part for me is that she's as healthy and as happy as she's ever been. Even at seven, she still plays like a puppy. At her last vet check (January 2011), the vet was thrilled at how great her teeth looked, praised the shine and texture of her coat (super shiny and soft as silk) as well as her high energy level. I write these comments because on the rare occasions that I've run out of her food and had to purchase another brand (other high end, vet recommended brands - my dog is very spoiled and always eats well), within two - three days her coat starts to dull and she doesn't seem as playful as is her norm.I'm sorry for the long review on dog food, but my Dobie is as much a part of my family as any of my human family. I'm extremely cautious of the food, treats, and chewy bones that I purchase for her. She has been, and continues to be the best of companions even if she is spoiled. This dog food is a bit more expensive than some others are, but to me it's worth it if it keeps her healthier longer.",

I couldn't have been happier!  I knew his history and that he's had skin problems since he was a baby.  Different vets have been unable to determine the cause of his itchy scratchy scaliness, and different medicines and types of food were tried.  This food hasn't been the cure, but he's doing much better since starting this last year.  His coat was always a bit thin and I never wanted to brush him for fear of irritating already irritated skin, but I actually had to buy him a brush this year.  His coat's filled out and he doesn't have as much skin problems as he used to have.  Thankfully he's just a little guy, otherwise this stuff would break the bank!  I've decided to stop buying from pet superstores because of some of their practices so I'm glad to have found this on Amazon!",

I understand the one review about the dogs not being interested in the food, but please, people of amazon, don't write negative reviews for products because your local store sold you an expired bag.  1) that has nothing to do with amazon, and 2) that really has nothing to do with the product quality -- the manufacturer didn't sell it to you that way, it was probably just on the shelf for too long.  It's misleading to people looking for products when something has 2 stars because someone got an expired bag from A DIFFERENT STORE.My dogs love this food, and I don't think I'll ever switch.

Imagine not eating red meat for a month and then slamming a big ol' steak.I went with the fish and potato because my doberman has some skin issues.  The dry skin cleared up after a while.  For some reason none of the dogs will eat the black bits in the food.  There aren't a lot of them, but I think it's odd.The only thing I really don't like about this food is the smell.  If you don't close the bag up tight it can smell very fishy around it, and your dogs breath will smell a little fishy after they eat it.  Other than that the pooches seem happy.",

The ingredients were fantastic for a pet-parent who's dog is allergic to anything with corn or chicken (which is hard to find).  I'm a trainer at Petsmart and told all of my clients about this product.  This was before I had to deal with their customer service department.  On my way home from work one night I realized I needed to stop and get a bag so I swung by a Complete Petmart and picked up a bag.  I got home and realized it had been expired for almost a year.  On the bag it said they guarantee their product 100% and this guarantee means they will tell you to take it back to the store and exchange it and that it was your fault that you didn't look at the expiration date.  Why did I have to do the leg work for someone who is paid to check the dates?  In my Petsmart, Blue Buffalo has a store rep who is supposed to be rotating product and she visits every week.  How is this my responsibility?  They kept sending harassing e-mails and would never really answer my question as to why the store representative let a bag of what is supposed to be a high-quality brand sit there expired for almost a year.  I have since switched my dog to Evo and happy to report his stools are much more solid and he absolutely loves it.  I'm sad the customer service for this company doesn't exist because I truly believed in their product.  The only reason it got 1 star is because the first ingredient is actual meat and not a meal.",

After all, I want only the best for them, and the ingredients sound fantastic. The problem is that my girls HATED it! I tried everything. First I mixed it with their old food, but they ate around the Blue, eating only the old food and leaving the Blue behind. Then I tried mixing it with moist food, but they ate only the moist. I tried mixing it with cheese, and they ate only the cheese. I wondered if, just maybe, they were unsure about what to do with the mixtures, so I cleaned their bowls and gave them only Blue. They still wouldn't eat it.Let me be clear about that: they had 24 hours of just the Blue, and they didn't eat any. Given the choice between starving and eating Blue, my girls chose to go hungry.Maybe my girls are just odd. Maybe they were uncomfortable with change. I don't know how to explain it, but the fact is that my two dogs detested the Blue. We wound up throwing it away, which is sad.",

With the money we save on it, we buy Blue wet food and mix it in with the dry food (about a quarter to half a can) to give our dog some variety and a little bit more enjoyment out of the meal.One of the problems we had with high protein brands like Evo is that she was having a difficult time digesting. I suppose we wouldn't notice if we didn't have to try and pick up after her! Of all the brands we've tried (Orijen, Lotus, Evo, Natural Balance, Ziwi, etc.) this one works the best for us.",

When I learned that, I switched immediately to food that doesn't have any in it (and most well known, readily available brands do).Our dog is very sensitive, and while she seemed to be doing well with BB's Wilderness Chicken, her poo smelled to the high heavens.  I read that it's often due to their not digesting chicken well; I guess she doesn't.  So, I switched her to the Lamb/Brown Rice formula.  She likes it, and, happily for everyone in the neighborhood, can digest it MUCH better (if you go by the stink factor).The only way she'll really go for it with enthusiasm (or any dry food) is to add some hot water to moisten it and release some aroma.  Otherwise, she holds out 'til right before she goes to bed 'cause she's starving.So, if your dog doesn't seem to like it, try adding a little hot water.  Our dog trainer (20 years experience) insists it's NOT bad for their teeth to do that (which I was concerned about initially).",

            "review_text": "We've been feeding our dogs BLUE products since they were puppies. We have two Boston Terriers; Boston's have notoriously sensitive digestive systems and are very prone to gas.  A diet without corn, wheat and soy (as well as no by-products) is best for them. (FYI- chicken by-products include head, feet, beaks, lungs, spleen, kidneys, brain, liver, stomach, bones, blood, intestines, and any other part of the carcass not fit for human consumption)  Our dogs LOVE it and I feel good feeding it to them.  I know that they are getting human grade foods; quality chicken, anti-oxidant rich fruits (blueberries,cranberries), healthy veggies (tomato,whole potatoes,sweet potatoes,peas,whole carrots) as well as high quality grains (brown rice,barley,oatmeal,rye,flaxseed).  BLUE also has glucosamine for healthy joints; sunflower & fish oils for a natural source of Omega 3 & 6 fatty acids. Essential amino acids (L-carnitine and L-lysine) for fat metabolism, calcium absorption and the building of muscle. The BLUE-exclusive Life Source Bits have vitamins, minerals and holistic supplements like rosemary, garlic, kelp, dried parsley, alfalfa meal, yucca, turmeric and chicory root. BLUE also adds healthy digestion-promoting cultures - lactobacillus, acidophilus, Bacilus subtilis and enterococcus faecium. Dogs love it and it's good for them - what else could you ask for?  (It's also available in an economical 30 lb. bag, too.)",

As a veterinary technician, I am aware of many common health problems in the breed, allergies being one of them. Knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies, I wanted a food that only used the best ingredients. I looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients. Blue Buffalo, it turned out, was the only such brand that was readily available in my area.The breeder had been feeding Eukanuba Puppy food, so I started \"Bruce\" on a mixture of the Eukanuba Puppy and the Blue Buffalo Puppy. He would actually pick out the Eukanuba and only eat the B.B. kibbles (one of my coworkers reports that her Dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to B.B.). So, I ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight B.B. He would, sometimes, pick out those \"Lifesource Bits\" and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at all.As he is now an adult, I have been feeding him a variety of the B.B. flavors. I started him with the B.B. Large Breed formula, then switched to the Fish and Sweet Potato, then the Lamb and so on. I am hoping that by rotating the formulas, I will be able to prevent or, at least, cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients. Since he quickly scarfs down any food I put down for him, I can't see that he has any preference to flavor. He loves them all.I can report that, to date, \"Bruce\" has been an extremely healthy dog. His coat is thick and shiny, his eyes are clear, and he is a very solid 95 Lbs. Everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is.

He will chew on his paws, lick his legs, do the fancy 3-leg-standing belly scratch, and often would lay on the brick hearth and scrape his chin back and forth.  Needless to say, this would cause his skin to be red, raw, often broken, etc.  Hot Spots weren't really a problem, but we could tell he was miserable.  Ear infections plagued him for about 3-4 months repeatedly... The vet was no help - the did try to alleviate his symptoms, but never tried to find the source of the problem.  I decided after researching for a while, that a food allergy was to blame.  I eradicated all corn and chicken from his diet, as these are common Bulldog allergens in food.  I slowly switched him to Blue Buffalo Fish and Sweet Potato formula.Previously, he had been on Eukanuba adult maintenance formula.  I had raised many dogs in my life with this food formula, and they had led long and healthy lives.  With a proper, slow integration of food, he did not encounter any loose stools, and his itching has greatly subsided.  i have had him on this food now for 3 weeks, now eating only this food.Bulldogs are BIG chewers, so I traded all his chicken basted rawhides for beef basted rawhides, and changed from Milkbone treats to another one made from Cranberries and Oatmeal with NO corn or poultry products.He was tentative at first with the food change, as he would normally eat once a day around 4:30. Now, with his new Blue Buffalo food, he eats the food as soon as it hits the bowl, and is a much happier dog.  His coat is healthier, and his shedding has slowed to a crawl!!!I highly recommend this food to anyone!",

            "review_text": "The \"Dynamic Duo,\" (a male Westie and a female Scotty), have been eating Blue Buffalo's Adult Weight Control Chicken and Brown Rice kibble for more than two years. Well, to be entirely honest, they eat equal parts of Blue Buffalo and Natural Ultramix, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots, and apples - and an occasional can of Halo or Evanger's. So why do we include the Blue Buffalo?First, because it is made from the best ingredients - if you were going to make the stuff yourself, besides chicken, you'd probably include grains like brown rice, barley, oats and rye, (no wheat, corn or soy), and vegetables like tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and sweet potatatoes, not to mention a few extras like blueberries, cranberries and, (I swear), green tea extract.Second, because they actually like it. And if you've got a finicky dog, you know what I'm talkin' about. Our Scotty will eat almost anything, (delicacy prevents me from going into any detail on this point), but our Westie? This is a dog for whom every bite is a thoughtfully considered proposition. Should I eat this? Hmmmmmm? Maybe not. Perhaps I should move it from my bowl to the living room carpet and contemplate it? Ah.... It's Blue Buffalo. I'll eat it.We generally buy the 6 pound bag - that means that we buy more frequently than we would if we were buying the larger sizes - but it's easier to store and stays fresher.Many people are concerned about feeding their dogs \"dry\" food - and to some extent, I share that concern. But when it's a quality product like Blue Buffalo and is fed as part of a \"menu\" that includes other fresh and healthy \"entrees,\" I think that it's an excellent addition to your dog's diet.[This is an up-date to my review: Economic times being what they are, something had to give - so a couple of months ago, we eliminated the Natural Ultramix from our terriers' diets. We also eliminated the canned foods, (my wife is convinced that even a small amount of canned food was contributing to our Scotty's tendency to put on a little extra weight). So we've been feeding them Blue Buffalo exclusively, supplemented with fresh boiled chicken, peas, carrots and apples. This change has had no ill effects on their health or appearence - and they continue to love the stuff. I remain convinced that when it comes to kibble, Blue Buffalo is an outstanding product.]",

Although I've been feeding cheaper brands to dogs in the past, I've since learned about the potential pet health impacts of doing so.  Overall, it's working out but not as well as it could be with my picky eater.My dog's a fan of several different varieties of the kibble, but *not* the LifeSource Bits (the little brown kibbles that have all the antioxidants that are one of the main benefits).  He picks them out and will only eat them when he's *really* hungry.  I've read plenty of reviews on pet-oriented sites about dogs who do the same.If your dog is not a picky eater, the kind who never finds the pill you hide in the food, you'll probably have no issues with this brand.  If your dog picks out the \"bits,\" you may have to feed him a little less or choose a different brand.",
